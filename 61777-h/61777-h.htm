<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>



<p>Among the papers which were left by Elias Hicks, there were
several manuscripts, written by himself, containing many particulars
respecting his life and religious engagements. His connexions
have collected these Memoirs, and now present them to
the notice of the public. In performing this office, they believe
that they will be rendering an acceptable and useful service to
his survivors. To those who were personally acquainted with
him, it will be interesting to review this brief record of his long
and useful life; and to all, it may be animating and instructive
to contemplate the feelings and experience of an individual, who,
it will be seen, was, in his retired moments, as fervent in his
aspirations for purity and humility of heart, as he was faithful
and diligent in his public labours for the promotion of truth and
righteousness in the earth.</p>

<p>Having experienced many mercies and preservations, both
spiritual and temporal, in passing through this probationary state,
I am induced to record some little account of them, under a sense
of humble gratitude to my gracious and merciful Creator and
Preserver.</p>

<p>I was born on the 19th day of the third month, 1748, in the
township of Hempstead, in Queens county, on Long Island.
My parents, John and Martha Hicks, were descended from
reputable families, and sustained a good character among their
friends and those who knew them. My father was a grandson
of Thomas Hicks, of whom our worthy friend Samuel Bownas
makes honourable mention in his journal, and by whom he was
much comforted and strengthened, when imprisoned through the
envy of George Keith, at Jamaica, on Long Island. Neither of
my parents were members in strict fellowship with any religious
society, until some little time before my birth. My father was at
that period united in membership with Friends; but as his residence
was mostly at some distance from meetings and in a neighbourhood
where very few Friends lived, my associates, when
young, were chiefly among those of other religious persuasions,
or, what was still worse for me, among those who made no pro<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[Pg 8]</span>fession
of religion at all. This exposed me to much temptation;
and though I early felt the operation of divine grace, checking
and reproving me for my lightness and vanity, yet being of a
lively active spirit, and ambitious of excelling in my play and
diversions, I sometimes exceeded the bounds of true moderation,
for which I often felt close conviction and fears on my pillow in
the night season.</p>

<p>When I was about eight years old, my father removed his
habitation and settled on a farm which his father had left him,
on the south side of the island, near the sea shore. This introduced
a new scene of diversion to my active mind, which was
prone to pleasure and self-gratification. The shore abounded
with fish and wild fowl, and I soon began to occupy myself with
angling for the former, and shooting the latter. These amusements
gained an ascendency in my mind, and although they
were diversions for which I felt condemnation at later periods,
yet I am led to believe that they were, at this time, profitable to
me in my exposed condition, as they had a tendency to keep me
more at and about home, and often prevented my joining with
loose company, which I had frequent opportunities of doing
without my father’s knowledge. My mother was removed by
death when I was about eleven years of age, and my father was
left with the care of six children, three older, and two younger,
than myself; and although he endeavoured to keep his children
within the limits of truth, yet opportunities sometimes occurred to
join with vain companions. But the Lord was graciously near
to my poor soul in my tender years; and he followed me with
his reproofs, and his dread made me afraid.</p>

<p>When I was about thirteen years of age, I was placed with one
of my elder brothers who was married, and lived at some distance
from my father’s residence. I was here without any parental
restraint; and mixing with gay associates, I lost much of my
youthful innocence, and was led wide from the salutary path of
true religion, learning to sing vain songs, and to take delight in
running horses. Yet I did not give way to any thing which
was commonly accounted disreputable, having always a regard to
strict honesty, and to such a line of conduct as comported with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[Pg 9]</span>
politeness and good breeding. Nevertheless, I became considerably
hardened in vanity, and on several occasions in riding races was
exposed to great danger; and had it not been for the providential
care of my heavenly father, my life would have fallen a
sacrifice to my folly and indiscretion. O my soul, what wilt, or
canst thou render unto the Lord for all his benefits, for his mercies
are new every morning!</p>

<p>About the seventeenth year of my age, I was put an apprentice
to learn the trade of a house carpenter and joiner, and this by no
means placed me in a more favourable situation than before; for
my master, although considered an orderly man, and one who
frequently attended Friends’ meetings, was yet in an eager pursuit
after temporal riches, and was of but little use to me in my
religious improvement. We had to go from place to place, as
our business called, to attend to our work, and I was thereby
introduced into hurtful company, and learned to dance and to
pursue other frivolous and vain amusements. During my apprenticeship
I passed through many trials and much exposure;
and I have often thought, that had it not been for the interposition
of divine mercy and goodness, I should have fallen a prey to the
varied temptations which surrounded me; for although I was
overtaken in many faults, in which my poor soul was deeply
wounded, and for which I afterwards felt the just indignation of
an offended God, yet when I have looked back on this scene of
my life, and recounted the many snares that I escaped, all that is
truly sensible within me has been bowed in humble admiration
of the Lord’s mercies and deliverance; and in reverent gratitude,
I was made to praise and magnify his great and adorable name,
“who is over all. God blessed for ever.” In the midst of my vanity
and exposure, the Lord, as a gracious father, was often near; and
when I was alone, he inclined my mind to solid meditations.&mdash;Some
of my leisure hours were occupied in reading the Scriptures,
in which I took considerable delight, and it tended to my
real profit and religious improvement.</p>

<p>My youthful companions would often endeavour to persuade
me and each other, that the amusements, in which we spent
much of our precious time, were innocent; yet being very early<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[Pg 10]</span>
convinced by the divine light that its teachings were truth, it had,
in my calmer moments, an ascendency in my mind over all the
reasonings and persuasions of men. Nevertheless, I had such a
proneness to levity and self-gratification, that I often ran counter
to clear conviction, and went on for a considerable time, sinning
and repenting; for the Lord in great mercy had regard to me
in my tried condition, and often opened a door of reconciliation to
my poor soul. But I was too weak to keep my covenants in the
midst of so many temptations, until by his righteous judgments,
mixed with adorable mercy, he opened to my mind, in a very
clear manner, the danger I was in of falling into eternal ruin.</p>

<p>Under the weight of this impression, my heart, in the midst of
merriment, was often made very sad; and while engaged in the
dance my soul was deeply sensible of its evil and folly: even my
reasoning powers, when thus enlightened by the clear evidence
of divine light, were made to loathe it as a senseless and insipid
pursuit, and utterly unworthy of a rational being. But although
I formed resolutions to refrain from this evil and others of a like
nature, yet it was difficult to resist the importunities of my companions;
and I found by experience, that if I would altogether
cease from them, I must wholly withdraw from the company of
those who were inclined to such pursuits. On the last occasion
that I was present at a dance, and in which I was pressed to
take a part, I was brought under great concern of mind, and
was struck with a belief, that if I now gave way after forming
so many resolutions, and should again rebel against the light, I
might be left in an obdurate situation, and never have another
offer of pardon. I also clearly saw that this would be just, and
that my blood would be upon my own head; and feeling the
dread of the Almighty to cover me, and a cry raised in my soul
towards him, when I was called to participate in the dance, it
seemed as though all my limbs were fettered, and I sat down
and informed the company that I was now resolved to go no
further. I was deeply tried, but the Lord was graciously near;
and as my cry was secretly to him for strength, he enabled me
to covenant with him, that if he would be pleased in mercy to
empower me, I would for ever cease from this vain and sinful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[Pg 11]</span>
amusement: and he instructed me, that if I would escape the
danger of another trial, I must keep myself separate from such
companions; and blessed for ever be his right worthy name, in
that he hath enabled me to keep this my covenant with him
from that time inviolate.</p>

<p>In looking back to this season of deep probation, my soul has
been deeply humbled; for I had cause to believe that if I had
withstood at this time the merciful interposition of divine love,
and had rebelled against this clear manifestation of the Lord’s
will, he would have withdrawn his light from me, and my portion
would have been among the wicked, cast out for ever from
the favourable presence of my judge. I should also for ever have
been obliged to acknowledge his mercy and justice, and acquit
the Lord my redeemer, who had done so much for me; for with
longsuffering and much abused mercy he had waited patiently
for my return, and would have gathered me before that time, as
I well knew, as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings,
but I would not. Therefore it is the earnest desire of my spirit,
that the youth, and others whom it may concern, may wisely
ponder their ways, and not think that the frivolous excuses which
those make, who endeavour to justify themselves in such vain
and wicked diversions, by saying that their parents judge it
innocent, or their teachers have instructed them so to believe, or
that under the law it was deemed admissible, will stand them in
any stead in the day of solemn inquisition: for what are all these
carnal reasonings worth, when weighed in the balance of the
sanctuary, against one single conviction of the divine light in
the secret of the heart. The last is clear and self-evident; the
others are mere evasive excuses: and I often reflect with surprise
on the conduct of those parents, who are spending their
substance in hiring idle dancingmasters to teach their children
this unnatural and unchristian practice, and who plead for excuse
the example of righteous David. But how unlike is their
dancing to his, who did it only in worship and honour to his
God, and in conformity with the outward dispensation under
which he lived. We have, however, a better and higher example
than David, the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the mediator of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[Pg 12]</span>
better covenant; this covenant is <i>inward</i>, even the law written
upon the heart, which no outward example of others can ever
abrogate or disannul; nor do his doctrines or self-denying example
in any wise approbate or justify this foolish and idle practice,
but, in all parts thereof, condemn and disapprove it: for if none
can be his disciples, except those who deny themselves, and take
up their cross daily, as assuredly no others can, how can those
be acceptable to him who are living in the daily gratification of
their own licentious wills, and spending their precious time and
talents in such fruitless and vain sports.</p>

<p>His self-denying apostles also have left us neither example nor
precept in justification of such wanton and evil amusements; but
we are exhorted by them to redeem the time, because the days
are evil, and to use diligence to make our calling and election sure,
and to follow them as they followed Christ: there is not a word
of learning to dance, or of dancingmasters, but an exhortation
to abstain from all idle and vain sports, and foolish talking and
jesting, which are contrary to Christian gravity, and to the self-denying
example of the blessed Jesus, who, when personally on
earth, was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief; and,
therefore, the house of mourning is recommended to all who are
wise in heart, for it is the fool’s heart only that is captivated in
the house of mirth.</p>

<p>My apprenticeship being now expired, I gradually withdrew
from the company of my former associates, became more acquainted
with Friends, and was more frequent in my attendance
of meetings; and although this was in some degree profitable to
me, yet I made but slow progress in my religious improvement,
until several years after I had entered into a married state. The
occupation of part of my time in fishing and fowling had frequently
tended to preserve me from falling into hurtful associations;
but through the rising intimations and reproofs of divine
grace in my heart, I now began to feel that the manner in which
I sometimes amused myself with my gun was not without
sin; for although I mostly preferred going alone, and while
waiting in stillness for the coming of the fowl, my mind was at
times so taken up in divine meditations, that the opportunities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[Pg 13]</span>
were seasons of instruction and comfort to me; yet, on other
occasions, when accompanied by some of my acquaintances, and
when no fowls appeared which would be useful to us after being
obtained, we sometimes, from wantonness or for mere diversion,
would destroy the small birds which could be of no service to us.
This cruel procedure affects my heart while penning these lines;
but my gracious Redeemer was drawing my mind from such
low amusements, and I was led to consider conduct like this
to be a great breach of trust, and an infringement of the divine
prerogative. It therefore became a settled principle with me, not
to take the life of any creature, except it was really useful and
necessary when dead, or very noxious and hurtful when living.
And, in exercising this privilege, we ought to be careful to do it
in the most mild and tender manner in our power; for I think
every candid mind must be convinced, that the liberty we have
for taking the lives of other creatures, and using their bodies to
support our own, is certainly an unmerited favour, and ought to be
received by us as the bounty of our great benefactor, and be
acknowledged with great humility and gratitude.</p>

<p>I have likewise from reflection, founded on observation, and
from the nature and reason of things, been led to believe, that we
frequently err by the liberty we take in destroying what we
esteem noxious creatures; and not only abuse the power given us
over them by our great Creator, but likewise act very contrary to our
own true interest. For, as all in the beginning was pronounced
good that the good God had made, we ought not to destroy any
thing that has life, for mere gratification. It is our indispensable
duty, as reasonable accountable beings, wisely to ponder our
ways, and consider the consequent effect of all our conduct; for
if we are to give an account of every idle word, how much more
so of every presumptuous act.</p>

<p>In the twenty-second year of my age, apprehending it right to
change my situation from a single to a married state, and having
gained an intimate acquaintance with Jemima Seaman, daughter
of Jonathan and Elizabeth Seaman, of Jericho, and my affection
being drawn towards her in that relation, I communicated my
views to her, and received from her a corresponding expression<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[Pg 14]</span>
of affection; and having the full unity and concurrence of our
parents and friends, we, after some time, accomplished our marriage
at a solemn meeting of Friends, at Westbury, on the 2d of
1st month, 1771. On this important occasion, we felt the clear
and consoling evidence of divine truth, and it remained with us
as a seal upon our spirits, strengthening us mutually to bear, with
becoming fortitude, the vicissitudes and trials which fell to our
lot, and of which we had a large share in passing through this
probationary state. My wife, although not of a very strong constitution,
lived to be the mother of eleven children, four sons
and seven daughters. Our second daughter, a very lovely
promising child, died when young with the small pox, and the
youngest was not living at its birth. The rest all arrived to
years of discretion, and afforded us considerable comfort, as they
proved to be in a good degree dutiful children. All our sons,
however, were of weak constitutions, and were not able to take
care of themselves, being so enfeebled as not to be able to walk
after the ninth or tenth year of their age. The two eldest died
in the fifteenth year of their age, the third in his seventeenth
year, and the youngest was nearly nineteen when he died. But,
although thus helpless, the innocency of their lives, and the resigned
cheerfulness of their dispositions to their allotments, made
the labour and toil of taking care of them agreeable and pleasant;
and I trust we were preserved from murmuring or repining,
believing the dispensation to be in wisdom, and according to the
will and gracious disposing of an all-wise providence, for purposes
best known to himself. And when I have observed the
great anxiety and affliction, which many parents have with
undutiful children who are favoured with health, especially their
sons, I could perceive very few whose troubles and exercises, on
that account, did not far exceed ours. The weakness and
bodily infirmity of our sons tended to keep them much out of the
way of the troubles and temptations of the world; and we believed
that in their death they were happy, and admitted into the realms
of peace and joy: a reflection, the most comfortable and joyous
that parents can have in regard to their tender offspring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>In the spring after our marriage, my wife’s relations gave me
an invitation to come and live with them, and carry on the business
of their farm, they having no other child than her. I
accepted this proposal, and continued with them during their
lives, and the place afterwards became my settled residence.
My advantages, in a religious point of view, were greater than
before; as I had the benefit of the company of several worthy
Friends, who were my neighbours, and by whose example I was
frequently incited to seriousness and piety; yet, having entered
pretty closely into business, I was thereby much diverted from
my religious improvement for several years. But, about the
twenty-sixth year of my age, I was again brought, by the operative
influence of divine grace, under deep concern of mind;
and was led, through adorable mercy, to see, that although I had
ceased from many sins and vanities of my youth, yet there were
many remaining that I was still guilty of, which were not yet
atoned for, and for which I now felt the judgments of God to
rest upon me. This caused me to cry earnestly to the Most
High for pardon and redemption, and he graciously condescended
to hear my cry, and to open a way before me, wherein I must
walk, in order to experience reconciliation with him; and as I
abode in watchfulness and deep humiliation before him, light
broke forth out of obscurity, and my darkness became as the
noonday. I had many deep openings in the visions of light,
greatly strengthening and establishing to my exercised mind.
My spirit was brought under a close and weighty labour in
meetings for discipline, and my understanding much enlarged
therein; and I felt a concern to speak to some of the subjects
engaging the meeting’s attention, which often brought unspeakable
comfort to my mind. About this time, I began to have
openings leading to the ministry, which brought me under close
exercise and deep travail of spirit; for although I had for some
time spoken on subjects of business in monthly and preparative
meetings, yet the prospect of opening my mouth in public meetings
was a close trial; but I endeavoured to keep my mind quiet
and resigned to the heavenly call, if it should be made clear to
me to be my duty. Nevertheless, as I was, soon after, sitting in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[Pg 16]</span>
a meeting, in much weightiness of spirit, a secret, though clear,
intimation accompanied me to speak a few words, which were
then given to me to utter, yet fear so prevailed, that I did not
yield to the intimation. For this omission, I felt close rebuke,
and judgment seemed, for some time, to cover my mind; but as
I humbled myself under the Lord’s mighty hand, he again lifted
up the light of his countenance upon me, and enabled me to
renew covenant with him, that if he would pass by this my
offence, I would, in future, be faithful, if he should again require
such a service of me. And it was not long before I felt an impressive
concern to utter a few words, which I yielded to in great
fear and dread; but O the joy and sweet consolation that my
soul experienced, as a reward for this act of faithfulness; and as
I continued persevering in duty and watchfulness, I witnessed
an increase in divine knowledge, and an enlargement in my
gift. I was also deeply engaged for the right administration of
discipline and order in the Church, and that all might be kept
sweet and clean, consistent with the nature and purity of the
holy profession we were making; so that all stumbling blocks
might be removed out of the way of honest inquirers, and that
truth’s testimony might be exalted, and the Lord’s name magnified,
“who is over all, God blessed for ever.”</p>

<p>A war, with all its cruel and destructive effects, having raged
for several years between the British Colonies in North America
and the mother country, Friends, as well as others, were exposed
to many severe trials and sufferings; yet, in the colony of New-York,
Friends, who stood faithful to their principles, and did not
meddle in the controversy, had, after a short period at first, considerable
favour allowed them. The yearly meeting was held
steadily, during the war, on Long Island, where the king’s
party had the rule; yet Friends from the Main, where the
American army ruled, had free passage through both armies to
attend it, and any other meetings they were desirous of attending,
except in a few instances. This was a favour which the
parties would not grant to their best friends, who were of a warlike
disposition; which shows what great advantages would
redound to mankind, were they all of this pacific spirit. I passed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[Pg 17]</span>
myself through the lines of both armies six times during the
war, without molestation, both parties generally receiving me
with openness and civility; and although I had to pass over a
tract of country, between the two armies, sometimes more than
thirty miles in extent, and which was much frequented by robbers,
a set, in general, of cruel unprincipled banditti, issuing out
from both parties, yet, excepting once, I met with no interruption
even from them. But although Friends in general experienced
many favours and deliverances, yet those scenes of war and confusion
occasioned many trials and provings in various ways to
the faithful. One circumstance I am willing to mention, as it
caused me considerable exercise and concern. There was a
large cellar under the new meeting-house belonging to Friends
in New-York, which was generally let as a store. When the
king’s troops entered the city, they took possession of it for the
purpose of depositing their warlike stores; and ascertaining
what Friends had the care of letting it, their commissary came
forward and offered to pay the rent; and those Friends, for want
of due consideration, accepted it. This caused great uneasiness
to the concerned part of the Society, who apprehended it not consistent
with our peaceable principles to receive payment for the
depositing of military stores in our houses. The subject was
brought before the yearly meeting in 1779, and engaged its
careful attention; but those Friends, who had been active in the
reception of the money, and some few others, were not willing
to acknowledge their proceedings to be inconsistent, nor to return
the money to those from whom it was received; and in order to
justify themselves therein, they referred to the conduct of Friends
in Philadelphia in similar cases. Matters thus appearing very
difficult and embarrassing, it was unitedly concluded to refer the
final determination thereof to the yearly meeting of Pennsylvania;
and several Friends were appointed to attend that meeting
in relation thereto, among whom I was one of the number. We
accordingly set out on the 9th day of the 9th month, 1779, and I
was accompanied from home by my beloved friend John Willis,
who was likewise on the appointment. We took a solemn leave
of our families, they feeling much anxiety at parting with us,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[Pg 18]</span>
on account of the dangers we were exposed to, having to pass
not only the lines of the two armies, but the deserted and almost
uninhabited country that lay between them, in many places the
grass being grown up in the streets, and many houses desolate
and empty. Believing it, however, my duty to proceed in the
service, my mind was so settled and trust-fixed in the divine arm
of power, that faith seemed to banish all fear, and cheerfulness
and quiet resignation were, I believe, my constant companions
during the journey. We got permission, with but little difficulty,
to pass the outguards of the king’s army at Kingsbridge, and
proceeded to Westchester. We afterwards attended meetings
at Harrison’s Purchase, and Oblong, having the concurrence of
our monthly meeting to take some meetings in our way, a concern
leading thereto having for some time previously attended my
mind. We passed from thence to Nine Partners, and attended
their monthly meeting, and then turned our faces towards Philadelphia,
being joined by several others of the Committee. We
attended New Marlborough, Hardwick, and Kingwood meetings
on our journey, and arrived at Philadelphia on the 7th day
of the week, and 25th of 9th month, on which day we attended
the yearly meeting of Ministers and Elders, which began at the
eleventh hour. I also attended all the sittings of the yearly
meeting until the 4th day of the next week, and was then so
indisposed with a fever, which had been increasing on me for
several days, that I was not able to attend after that time. I was
therefore not present when the subject was discussed, which came
from our yearly meeting; but I was informed by my companion,
that it was a very solemn opportunity, and the matter was resulted
in advising that the money should be returned into the
office from whence it was received, accompanied with our reasons
for so doing: and this was accordingly done by the direction
of our yearly meeting the next year.</p>

<p>The yearly meeting closed on the 2d day of the following
week; and feeling my health a little restored, though still very
weak, I left the city, and was taken by my kind friend John
Shoemaker to his house. The next morning being rainy, and
being still unwell, I rested here during the day, but my com<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[Pg 19]</span>panion
proceeded to attend the monthly meeting at the Falls.
The next day I went to Byberry meeting, after which I rode
with our valuable friend James Thornton to John Watson’s, at
Middletown, where I was again joined by my companion. We
attended their monthly meeting, and found things in but poor
order, and discipline at a low ebb, for want of faithful standard
bearers. We then attended meetings, to some satisfaction, at
Wright’s Town, Plumbstead, and Buckingham. From thence
we proceeded to the monthly meeting at Hardwick, where things
appeared very low as to the right exercise of discipline; but feeling
our minds engaged, we laboured, in the ability received, for
their assistance and encouragement. After this we passed on
to the Drowned Lands, and attended a meeting with the few
Friends of that place, and some others who came in; but things,
pertaining to religion, seemed at a very low ebb with them, which
makes hard work for the poor traveller. From thence we went
pretty directly to Nine Partners, and after having two meetings
there, we proceeded to Oswego and <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Appoquague">Apoquague</span>, and then to the
monthly meeting at Oblong, in all which meetings truth was
exalted, and I left them with peace of mind. We then turned
our faces homeward, and after going a few miles on our way, we
were overtaken by a constable, with a warrant from a magistrate
to bring my companion before him, who, after examination,
committed him to a board of commissioners, as a dangerous
person to travel at such a time. We were led to believe, on
inquiry, that this interruption was merely the fruit of envy, and
occasioned by two acquaintances of my companion, who had
fled from the Island for refuge. However, after a short detention,
which gave me an opportunity of visiting a few families of
my relations, and of attending a small meeting which I had
passed from in some heaviness before, he was set at liberty, and
we attended the quarterly meeting at Oblong. After this we
passed on, taking meetings at Peachpond, Amawalk, and the
monthly meeting at Purchase, and from thence proceeded home.
I found my family well, which, together with the preservations
and favours experienced in our journey, impressed my mind with
thankfulness and gratitude to the great and blessed author of all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[Pg 20]</span>
our mercies. I was from home in this journey about nine weeks,
and rode about eight hundred and sixty miles.</p>

<p>After the close of the aforesaid journey, I felt my mind engaged
to make a general visit to Friends on the Main belonging
to our yearly meeting; and with the concurrence of Friends,
and in company with William Valentine, who, under a like concern,
had agreed to be my companion, I left home on the 1st
of the week, and 4th of 3d month, 1781, in order to accomplish
the same. We sat with Friends in our own meeting, and then
proceeded to Flushing; and the next day, the commanding officer
of the king’s troops at this place permitting us, we crossed
the Sound to Frog’s Neck, and lodged with our friend Joseph
Caustin. On the following day we attended an appointed meeting
at Westchester, and then went forward, taking meetings as
they came in course for fifteen days successively, the last at Little
Nine Partners: and although in many places meetings appeared
in a low state, as to the life of religion, yet, through divine
favour, help was afforded, insomuch that I generally left them
with the satisfactory evidence, that my way had been rightly
directed among them.</p>

<p>After the last mentioned meeting we set forward towards Saratoga,
and lodged that night at an inn. The innkeeper’s wife,
in the course of some conversation, discovered that my companion
and I were from Long Island, where the king’s party bore rule;
and she, being a friend to their cause, seemed to wonder much,
that we should leave them, and come out among the Americans,
signifying that if she was there, she should not be willing to
come away; and when I informed her that I expected we should
shortly return thither again, her admiration was still more excited,
and she was surprised how we should dare to act so:
whereupon I took occasion to acquaint her how we stood in
regard to the contending parties; informing her that as we took
no part in the controversy, but were friends to them and to all
mankind, and were principled against all wars and fightings, the
contending powers had such confidence in us, and favour towards
us, that they let us pass freely on religious accounts, through
both their armies without interruption; a privilege, which they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[Pg 21]</span>
would not grant to their own people. This account made her
marvel greatly, having never heard of the like before. She
acknowledged it was very good, and wished for herself that she
could come into the same situation, but said she could not, unless
she first had retaliation for the wrongs she had received, after
which, she said she should be willing to forgive them; not considering,
that there was nothing to be forgiven, where full pay
or satisfaction had been received. Nevertheless, this is the natural
condition and disposition of all worldly-minded men and women,
who have not known, through the powerful influence of the
gospel of Christ, the work of regeneration and the new birth,
whereby they might experience redemption from such a malicious
and revengeful spirit.</p>

<p>On the next day we proceeded to Coeman’s Patent, on the
west side of Hudson river, which we crossed at a place called
Claverack landing. We reached there on 7th day evening,
and the following day had a meeting with the few Friends,
who had lately settled at that place, and some of their neighbours,
who were mostly Baptists. It was the first Friends’ meeting
ever held there, and was a satisfactory season. We then rode
that afternoon about twelve miles towards Albany, and lodged
at an inn; and the next day we reached Saratoga, since called
Easton, and lodged with our friend Daniel Cornell. It was late
in the night before we arrived, and the evening snowy; and
the country being newly settled, Friends’ houses were generally
but poor, so that several times, while in these parts, I felt the
snow fall on my face when in bed. This affected me with a
heavy cold when I first came here, but afterwards I was much
favoured during the journey, having in good measure become
inured to the hardships we had to go through. We attended
the meetings belonging to this monthly meeting, being four
in number; viz. Saratoga alias Easton, Danby about forty miles
further to the north east, White Creek, and Hoosack. The
monthly meeting was held alternately at this latter place and
Saratoga. We also visited nearly all the families belonging to
this monthly meeting, and had good satisfaction, and a peaceful
reward of our labours. From thence we went to New Britain,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[Pg 22]</span>
and visited three families, in each of which there was but one
member of our Society. We then returned to Nine Partners, and
attended their monthly meeting, also several other meetings in
that neighbourhood which we were not at in our way up. After
this we attended Oblong quarterly meeting, and next the monthly
meeting of Shapaqua; and then taking meetings at Purchase,
Mamaroneck and Westchester, we passed the Sound again, and
got safe home the 15th day of 5th month. I was gladly received
by my family and friends, having been absent on this journey
about ten weeks, and rode about eight hundred and fifty miles.
We attended thirty-two meetings, six of which were monthly meetings,
and one quarterly meeting, and visited about ninety families.</p>

<p>It was in the latter part of this journey, between Mamaroneck
and Westchester, that we met with the interruption, which I
before alluded to, from some of those robbers, who frequented the
country between the two armies. I was a little ahead of my
companion and some other Friends, and was met, and accosted
by two of those persons in a very rough manner. I did not see
them until they spoke, and one of them demanded very rudely
to know where we were going. I looked calmly upon him, and
informed him, without the least interruption of mind, where we
were intending to go. He then interrogated me further, as to
where we had been, what our business was, and where we were
from, to all of which I gave true and suitable answers in a mild
and pleasant tone. They seemed thereby to be entirely disarmed
of their rage and violence, although they had just before
robbed and beat a man; and the one, who had hitherto stood
silent, being the most overcome, said to his fellow, “Come, let
us go, the Quakers go where they please;” and, then turning
away, they left us to pursue our journey without further interruption.
I considered this as a merciful preservation through the
interference of divine providence, who, by his power, not only sets
bounds to the sea, and saith, “Hitherto shalt thou come, but no
further; and here shall thy proud waves be stayed,” but also
limits the rage and will of wicked men, and turns them from their
purpose; and thereby delivers, from their power and cruelty,
those that put their trust in him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>In the fall of the year 1781, I was taken sick with a fever,
which lasted for several months, in the course of which my
strength became very much exhausted, and some of my friends
were ready to conclude, that I should not continue long with
them; yet, through the whole of my indisposition, I had to
believe that I should recover. But through the exercise and
distress both of body and mind which I experienced, it proved
a very humbling dispensation to me. One circumstance in
particular made it peculiarly exercising to my mind, although it
was that on which I principally grounded my belief of recovery.
When I was reduced nearly to the lowest state of bodily weakness,
a prospect opened on my mind to pay a religious visit to
some parts of our island where no Friends lived, and among a
people, who, from the acquaintance I had with them, were more
likely to mock, than to receive me, seeing that I considered
myself but a child in such a service. But when the prospect first
presented, it was very impressive on my mind, and an injunction
seemed to attend requiring my assent thereto; and although
I pleaded as an excuse my weakness and inability of body, as
well as my unfitness, even if I was well, for such a service, yet
with all my reasonings and pleadings I could feel no excuse
granted me, and the requisition lay heavy upon me both day
and night. By my thus standing out, I was brought very low both
in body and mind; and finding that I could get no peace in this
state of refusal, and that if I did not yield, my life must be taken
for my stubbornness without any prospect of peace hereafter, I
at length yielded to the heavenly call, which brought immediate
peace and comfort to my afflicted soul; and the Lord was very
gracious, opening many things for my encouragement. In the
forepart of the next summer, having fully recovered my health, and
apprehending the right time had arrived to perform this service,
I opened it to the monthly meeting, and obtained its unity and
concurrence, and two Friends agreed to bear me company. We
set out about the middle of the 8th month, 1782, and had a very
favoured meeting at Jamaica, with a considerable number of
the inhabitants. After this we had a meeting at Samuel Doughty’s,
on the south side of the island, and then passed on to a Dutch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[Pg 24]</span>
settlement called Flatlands, where we had some difficulty to
obtain a meeting, in consequence of the priest of the place being
opposed thereto. The people seemed generally afraid to offend
him, but said that if he would consent, they should be very
willing to attend. However his assent could not be obtained,
for he appeared very jealous lest his interest in the people should
be affected. But there was one man, who seemed so much
master of his own house, that he said we were welcome to have
a meeting in it, let others say what they might. A meeting was
accordingly appointed, which, although small, was a satisfactory
opportunity. The master of the house and his wife, in an especial
manner, seemed much affected therewith, and pressed us to
come and see them again. From thence we passed on, and had
meetings at Gravesend, New-Utrecht, and Springfield, all to good
satisfaction. From the latter we proceeded home, feeling the
comfortable reward of peace for this service, and very thankful to
the Lord, my gracious helper, for his countenance and support
therein. May his name be praised for ever.</p>

<p>In the latter part of 1782, I attended, with a committee of the
yearly meeting, the quarterly meeting on the Main, and the
monthly meetings thereunto belonging, on a proposition from
the said quarterly meeting for a division thereof. We were
absent about seven weeks, and rode about six hundred and sixty
miles.</p>

<p>In the fall of the year 1783, I attended the quarterly meeting
at Nine Partners, also the meeting for sufferings, which was held
there at this time; and, on my return, I was at the meetings
held at Oswego and Perquage. I was from home about eleven
days, and rode about one hundred and seventy miles. The reward
of peace which I felt for this little service, and finding my
family well on my return, excited gratitude and thankfulness of
heart to the author of all our mercies and blessings; who richly
rewardeth every labour of his dependent and devoted children.</p>

<p>A concern having for some time impressed my mind to pay a
religious visit to the inhabitants of some of the adjacent towns,
who were not in profession with us, and having obtained the
unity and concurrence of my friends therein, I left home on the
1st day of the week, and 13th of 6th month, 1784, in order to
perform that service. I attended our own meeting in the forenoon;
and, in the afternoon, one appointed at Hempstead Harbour,
to good satisfaction. Our next appointment was on 2d
day, at a village called Herricks, where there was but little profession
as to religion; nevertheless, we had a refreshing season
among them. The power and presence of the Lord were witnessed
to preside amongst us in an eminent manner. Many
hearts were tendered; and the peaceable kingdom and government
of the Messiah was exalted: to Zion’s king may all the
praise be ascribed, who only is worthy for ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>From thence we went to the widow Cornell’s at Success,
where we lodged, and had a satisfactory meeting there the next
day; many present were affected by the power of truth, which
ran freely over all, to the comfort and refreshment of the sincere-hearted.
After this we rode to Benjamin Doughty’s and lodged;
and the next day we had a meeting at the Little Plains, about a
mile from our lodgings, among a loose airy people. The Lord’s
power was manifest for our help, bringing things close home to
their several conditions. The day following, we attended two
meetings, one at Jamaica, and the other at a place called the
Fresh Meadows, near Flushing. Although the people were too
generally at ease, and in an unconcerned state, with regard to their
religious improvement, yet, through the interposition of divine
goodness and mercy, some hearts were tendered by the convicting
power of truth, and ourselves comforted in the faithful discharge
of duty. After these opportunities, we rode to our friend Isaac
Underhill’s at Flushing, and lodged; and the next day attended
a meeting appointed in Friends’ meeting-house in that town,
wherein the Master’s presence was witnessed, to the comfort and
satisfaction of the upright in heart.</p>

<p>From thence we went to Newtown, and lodged with a man
not in profession with us. We had a meeting at his house the
following day, wherein the spirit of truth favoured with gospel
communication, suited to the states of those present, and relieving
to my own mind. The four following days we attended meetings
at the Kilns in Newtown, Bushwick, Brooklyn, Flatbush,
Flatlands, and Gravesend. After the last, we turned our faces
homeward, having a meeting at Samuel Doughty’s, and another
at a wigwam, among the black people and Indians; both satisfactory
seasons. The next meeting was at Springfield, among
a people, who appeared to be in a state of great darkness; but
the Lord was pleased, by his own power, to command the light
to shine in many hearts; insomuch that the meeting ended
under divine favour. To Him alone may all the praise be
ascribed, who is worthy for ever. The day following, attended
two meetings; one at Foster’s Meadow, the other at the widow
Keziah Mott’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>After this we rode to my father’s at Rockaway, on the south
side of the Island; and the next day attended a meeting there.
The day following attended two meetings at Hempstead South,
the latter at the house of our friend John Smith; all I trust, in
a good degree, profitable and instructive seasons. Our next and
last appointment, at this time, was in the town of Hempstead, the
following day. It was a large satisfactory opportunity; wherein
divine help was afforded to minister suitably to the states of those
present, and to the comfort and edification of many minds. To
the Master of our assemblies, be the praise. Nothing is due to
man. From hence I returned home, and found my family well;
having rode, whilst out, about one hundred miles.</p>

<p>A few weeks after my return from the aforesaid visit to the
inhabitants of some of the adjacent towns, not feeling my mind
relieved from the service, I again left home on the 4th of the 8th
month following, in order to finish the visit. The first meeting
I attended was again at Hempstead; and from thence proceeded
along the south side of the island, having meetings at Thomas
Seaman’s near Jerusalem, and Thomas Sands’ at Huntington
South. The next was at Islip, on 7th day; but not feeling
clear, I appointed another the following day, being the 1st of the
week. This proved a satisfactory season. The same afternoon,
I attended another meeting about thirteen miles farther east, at a
place called Blue Point. Thence passing on along the south
side of the island, I attended meetings at Patchogue, the Fire
Place, South Hampton, North Sea, Amaganset and Montauk at
the east end of the island, among the Indian natives. In all of
them, strength was afforded to preach the gospel in a good degree
of divine authority, and to the general satisfaction of those
assembled, and the solid peace of my own mind.</p>

<p>After the meeting at Montauk among the natives, we returned
that afternoon to a meeting at East Hampton, which we had
appointed in our way down, and was held at the fifth hour. The
priest of the town, and a considerable number of his hearers,
attended, and all passed away quiet. We went from thence to
the north part of the island, having meetings at Sagharbour,
Shelter Island, South Hold, Oyster Pond Point, and Stephen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[Pg 28]</span>
Vail’s, a little back from the Point; thence back by Riverhead
to St. George’s Manor, where we had a meeting, and all satisfactory
seasons. We passed from thence by Wading River
to Setauket, and Stonybrook, holding meetings at the two
last places to good satisfaction. The meeting at Setauket, especially,
was a solemn time; the Lord’s presence was witnessed, to
the tendering many hearts. After this we took meetings at
Jonah Wood’s, and James Oakley’s, and from thence returned
home, and found my family well; for which favour, with the
peace and satisfaction I felt in the performance of this tour of
duty, my mind was inspired with gratitude and humble acknowledgments
to the Lord, my gracious helper.</p>

<p>In the 12th month following, feeling my mind drawn to a
few places eastward, on the north part of the island, I again left
home on the 2d of said month, and took meetings at Huntington,
Cowharbour, Crab Meadow, Smithtown, Setauket, Wading
River, Quoram, Joshua Smith’s near the branch; and from
thence home. In all those meetings, truth favoured me with
ability to discharge myself faithfully, to the peace of my own
mind; and, I trust, to the edification and instruction of the honest-minded
in the several meetings.</p>

<p>Having felt drawings on my mind to pay a religious visit to
some, not in profession with us, on the western part of our island,
New-York, and Staten Island, and obtaining the concurrence of
our monthly meeting, I proceeded therein, the 28th of 3d month,
1790, Fry Willis kindly bearing me company. Our first appointment
was at Newtown, at the widow Smith’s, who received us,
and opened her house for a meeting, which was held to good
satisfaction. The next day we had two meetings; the first, at
Friends’ meeting-house at the Kilns, the other, in the evening,
at a neighbouring village, called Juniper Swamp; both favoured
seasons, many hearts being tendered by the prevalence of the
spirit of truth, which, through heavenly help, was exalted over
all. The day following, way opening therefor, we had a meeting
at Hurlgate in the afternoon, to the general satisfaction of those
present, and to my own comfort; having been enabled to discharge
myself faithfully, in a plain way among them. After this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[Pg 29]</span>
we proceeded to New-York, and the evening of the next day, we
had a large, and, I trust, profitable meeting, in a public building
called the City Tavern. Our next appointment was in Friends’
meeting-house, the evening following; it was a very large collection,
and, through the gracious extendings of divine mercy, the
power of truth was exalted over all, to the comfort and strength of
my own mind, and the solid satisfaction and rejoicing of many
present.</p>

<p>The day following we passed to Staten Island, and the next
day, being the 1st of the week, we had two meetings: the first,
at the house of Peter Prawl, who was favourably inclined towards
Friends. It was a favoured season, wherein the Master’s presence
was witnessed eminently to preside, and in the precious
influence thereof, the gospel was preached in demonstration of the
Spirit, and with power, to the awakening and tendering the hearts
of many present: to the Lord only wise, be the praise and glory
of his own work; for he only is worthy for ever. The meeting
in the afternoon, held at the house of the widow of our friend
Thomas Ridgway, proved a trying season, but I trust ended well.
We had two more meetings on the island the next day, and the
solemnity attending gave encouragement to hope, that they were
of some use to those assembled. After this we returned to
New-York with peace of mind, accompanied with the good wishes
of many of those we had visited.</p>

<p>The day after our arrival in the city, Friends’ monthly meeting
was held, which we attended; and the evening of the next day,
we had a large satisfactory meeting in the suburbs of the town,
in a large building called the Hospital. The next day, at the
tenth hour, visited the poor in the poor house. The visit was
comfortable and satisfactory. At the third hour we had a pretty
full meeting, in a house belonging to the Methodists, which they
offered us for that purpose; and in the evening we had another
large meeting in Friends’ meeting house; both satisfactory seasons,
and, I trust, comfortable and edifying to many who attended.
The next day we visited a few families of Friends, as way opened,
which closed our visit for this time to the city. The day after,
being the first of the week, and the 11th of 4th month, we had a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[Pg 30]</span>
satisfactory meeting at Brooklyn. The two following days we
attended two meetings on our way home, the first at Samuel
Doughty’s, at Jamaica South, the latter in Jamaica town; both
favoured seasons, although many who attended were light and
airy; yet the power of truth rising into dominion, a comfortable
solemnity was spread over the assemblies. I left them in the
enjoyment of true peace of mind, and returned to my family the
evening following, and found all well; which, with other unmerited
favours, witnessed in the course of this little engagement,
filled my mind with thankful acknowledgments to the Shepherd
of Israel, who is over all, worthy for ever.</p>

<p>In the latter part of the summer of this year, I performed a
visit, in company with James Parsons of New-York, to some
people favourably disposed towards Friends, who resided in the
towns of Strafford and Sharon, in the State of Vermont, about
fifteen miles west of Connecticut river. I left home the 28th of
7th month, and attended Purchase quarterly meeting, and a
meeting on first day, at Cornwall in Connecticut, on our way,
and then passed on to Northampton on Connecticut river; from
thence up the east side of the river, through Massachusetts and
part of New Hampshire, as far as Hanover; then crossing the
river, we rode about fifteen miles westerly, to the town of Strafford,
to the house of Timothy Blake, who was principally instrumental
in collecting those people. Their first meeting was at
his house. He appeared convinced of the principle of the inward
light, as held by us; and had gathered a number into the same
belief, in a good degree. They held two meetings when we
came among them, one at his house, and the other at the adjacent
town of Sharon; but, for want of keeping inward enough to
the principle of divine light and grace, they became weak; and
those, who apprehended it their duty to teach, had got too much
out into words and speculative preaching and doctrine, which soon
produced discord and a schism among them. They appeared to
have been at times much favoured, and several of them had their
understandings considerably illumined; insomuch that they
were joined, at their request, in membership with Friends, and
their meetings came under Friends’ notice; but being far dis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[Pg 31]</span>tant
from any other meeting of the society, and not keeping low
and little enough, they mostly became bewildered and scattered,
and their meetings dropped. Yet a few kept, or regained, their
first love; several of whom afterwards removed nearer to Friends.
We passed several days among them; and then, taking leave,
returned homeward by Danby, Saratoga alias Easton, and Hudson,
to Nine Partners, attending meetings as they fell in our way,
and reached Nine Partners in time for their quarterly meeting.
After this we passed pretty directly home, attending a meeting at
Shapaqua on first day. I was from home, on this journey,
about three weeks and five days, attended two quarterly meetings,
and seven particular meetings, and travelled about five
hundred and ninety-one miles.</p>

<p>In the latter part of the winter, and spring of the ensuing
year, in the drawings of gospel love, and with the unity of my
friends, I performed a visit to a number of the adjacent towns
and villages on our island, among those not in profession with
us. I was from home about two weeks, and attended fifteen
meetings, and rode about one hundred and fifteen miles.</p>

<p>A prospect having for some time impressed my mind to make a
general visit to Friends of our yearly meeting, and to have some
meetings among those not in profession with us, in parts adjacent,
with the concurrence of my brethren at home, I set out on
this service, the 23d of 10th month, 1791, and had meetings at
Flushing, Newtown and Brooklyn, on my way to New-York.
Our quarterly meeting was held there at this time; it ended on
the sixth day of the week, and was a solemn season, and graciously
owned by the Master’s presence; many weighty subjects
were opened through well qualified instruments, to the satisfaction
and encouragement of the living. We were favoured with
the company of our beloved friend Mary Ridgway, and her
companion, from Ireland. The 29th, I proceeded on my journey,
with Andrew Underhill, who had kindly given up to bear me
company. We went by water to Staten Island, and the next
day, being the first of the week, we attended two appointed
meetings, the first at the house of a man inclined to Friends,
whose wife was convinced of our principles; the latter at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[Pg 32]</span>
house of a professor among the Methodists. Both were favoured
seasons, many hearts being tendered through gospel communication,
which flowed freely to the people. The 31st, we had
another meeting on the island, at the house of the widow Ridgway;
after this, in the evening, we had a favoured and instructive
season with the widow’s family. The next day we
passed over to Rahway, in East Jersey. And on fourth day, the
2d of 11th month, we attended Friends’ meeting at Plainfield,
and an appointed meeting in the evening at Elijah Pound’s, near
Brunswick; both, I trust, profitable seasons to some present.&mdash;We
returned next morning to Rahway, and attended Friends’
meeting in that place; and one in the evening at Woodbridge,
and returned to Rahway to lodge. The next day we passed over
again to Staten Island, and had two meetings in the south-western
part, wherein help was afforded to discharge myself faithfully,
in a plain way, suited, as I believe, to the states of those who
attended; they were of different professions, being Episcopalians,
Presbyterians, Baptists, and Methodists. We returned again on
seventh day evening to our lodgings at Rahway, to the house of
our kind friend Joseph Shotwell; and the next day, being the first
of the week, and 6th of the 11th month, we attended their forenoon
and afternoon meetings; both, I trust, instructive edifying
seasons, worthy of remembrance. To the Lord only wise, be the
praise and glory of his own work, for to him it is due.</p>

<p>The following day we attended an appointed meeting at the
eleventh hour in Elizabethtown, at the house of our friend
Joseph Stackhouse; and, although small, yet it proved a satisfactory
season; and in the evening, one at Newark, held in
their court-house, which was large and much crowded. I was
drawn forth among them in a large doctrinal testimony, I believe
to general satisfaction, and greatly to the peace and relief of my
own mind. Our next appointment was on the evening following,
at a place called the English Neighbourhood, on the east side of
Hackensack river, at the house of Thomas Frost, a physician.
Although it was the first meeting appointed by Friends, ever
held at that place, and the people mostly unacquainted with us
and our principles, yet they came freely together, and generally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[Pg 33]</span>
behaved in an orderly and commendable manner. The meeting
was much favoured, being evidently owned by the Head of the
Church; and ability was received to communicate divers things,
relative to the true ground of real religion and spiritual worship,
which appeared to obtain the general assent of those present.
The next day, in the evening, we had a meeting at the house of
our friend Daniel Lawrence, at Tappan, which, although small,
was in the main a satisfactory season. On the three following
days, we had two meetings, by appointment, on our way to Cornwall;
one at Kakiat, at the house of the widow Seaman, the
other at William Thorne’s, at Smith’s Clove. In going to the
latter place, we rode over the western part of the mountains, called
the Highlands. We got to the house of our friend William
Titus, at Cornwall, on seventh day evening. The next day
attended Friends’ meeting there, and one, by appointment, in the
evening at New Windsor; and lodged with our friend James
Thorne. The next day crossed the Hudson river, and had a
meeting at Fishkill, in our way to Nine Partners; where we
arrived on 3d day, and attended the quarterly meeting of Ministers
and Elders, which opened at the eleventh hour. The two
following days, the meeting for discipline and a parting meeting
for public worship, were held. They were all favoured seasons,
in which the faithful had cause to bless the name of the Lord, for
his mercy in manifesting his gracious presence for the strength
and help of his people and servants; in a sense whereof, we
parted from each other with mutual rejoicing.</p>

<p>On sixth day, we rode to Sharon in Connecticut, and the
day following held a meeting for the town’s people in a large
upper room in their school-house. A considerable number
attended: and, through heavenly goodness, it proved a memorable
time; the testimony of truth went freely forth among
them, powerfully reaching and tendering many hearts. To the
Lord alone, be the praise.</p>

<p>After this meeting, we rode to the house of Simeon Prague,
about three miles north of the town, and attended a meeting
there that evening. Next day, being the first of the week, we
rode to Goshen, and attended the meeting held there, at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[Pg 34]</span>
house of Charles Richards; notice having gone before of our
coming, it was a pretty full meeting, and ended to satisfaction.
We passed from thence to Tyringham, in the state of Massachusetts;
and, on third day, attended a meeting in that neighbourhood.
Then travelling on that afternoon and the next day,
we got to Westfield, and lodged at an inn; and the following
day, held a meeting at our lodgings, for the neighbourhood.
After this we rode to Norwich, and attended a meeting that
evening at the house of Phineas Mixer, which proved, through
heavenly help, a comfortable edifying season, although the general
part of those who attended were strangers to us and our principles.
The three following days, we passed on through the
towns of Northampton, Hadley, Sunderland, Montague, Northfield
and Walpole, to John Cook’s, in Claremont, where we
appointed a meeting to be held the next day. Our landlord
undertook to give the notice to his neighbours; and having heard
that Friends sometimes sit their meetings in silence, he was
afraid, as he afterwards informed me, to notify any of the meeting,
except two or three of his particular friends; lest, if it should
prove silent, they might laugh him to scorn. In consequence
thereof, the meeting was very small. But such was the kindness
of divine Providence, that he did not fail to manifest his
presence powerfully among, as it were, the two or three, to the
conviction and reproof of our unfaithful landlord; insomuch that
he informed me, when I came that way again, that his folly and
blindness had given him much trouble and distress; and he was
now very pressing and desirous I would appoint another meeting,
that he might give all the neighbourhood general notice.
But we let him know, that we were not at our own disposal;
and, as no way appeared open in our minds for such an appointment
at present, we could not comply with his desire.</p>

<p>After the last mentioned meeting, we passed the next day to
Windsor, the most south-easterly town in the state of Vermont,
on the west side of Connecticut river. Here we had a meeting
in their court-house, which was very commodiously fitted up for
the purpose, and proved a solid satisfactory opportunity. After
this we rode to James Willard’s, in the town of Hartland; who,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[Pg 35]</span>
although brought up without any particular knowledge of Friends,
was yet so far one in principle with us, that he had maintained,
by himself alone, a testimony against a hireling ministry, against
fighting, and oaths, and the superstitious observance of days;
and had, by sound reasoning, so far defeated all his opponents,
that he was permitted to remain quiet; although his residence
had mostly been among those rigid in the Presbyterian profession.
We had a meeting in his house, which appeared always
to be open to Friends, after his gaining an acquaintance with
them; but it being on the day set apart by those in authority as
a day of thanksgiving, the meeting was small.</p>

<p>We took leave of our kind landlord, and journeyed forward;
and got to the town of Sharon the next day, to the house of Jared
Bassett, who, with some of his neighbours, who were likewise
measurably convinced of our principles, held meetings together,
after our manner. Here we continued some days, visiting those
people, and attended their meeting on first day, the 4th of 12th
month; which, through favour, was, I trust, a profitable, edifying
season.</p>

<p>On third day we rode over to Hanover, a town on the east
side of Connecticut river. And the day following had a meeting
in the east part of said town, among a people mostly of the
Baptist profession; it was, I trust, an instructive season; things,
relating to true religion and spiritual worship, being largely opened.
And after the meeting, we had some free conversation on
several material points; viz. election, falling from grace, water
baptism and the right use of the scriptures, all of which were
opened apparently to the satisfaction of most present. The
evening of the next day, we had an appointed meeting near
Dartmouth College, which proved a very disturbed opportunity,
by reason of the attendance of the young students, whose behaviour
was very rude and unbecoming; nevertheless, I hope
the season was profitable to some present.</p>

<p>We returned the next day to Jared Bassett’s, at Sharon, and
the following day attended two meetings, one at Strafford, and
the other in the evening at a place called the Hollow. After this
we returned again to Jared Bassett’s, and the next day, being the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[Pg 36]</span>
first of the week, and the 11th of 12th month, we attended the
meeting at his house; which, with the two last, were, to myself
at least, satisfactory seasons; feeling conscious of having discharged
my duty faithfully among them, and having the answer
of peace therein. The next day we set out for Danby, the nearest
meeting of Friends to this place; but by reason of a great fall
of snow, and the way being mountainous, we did not arrive there
until the third day after we set out. The next day after our
arrival, their monthly meeting began, which continued two days.
It was a low time, wherein I felt my mind much oppressed with
the apparent careless indifferent way in which Friends there conducted
the weighty affairs of the Church; many of them appearing
to act in their own will, in as light a manner, as they would
in their own trivial outward business. Much labour was bestowed
in a plain way, in order to impress their minds with the
necessity of being more weighty in their spirits, when they presumed
to be active in the affairs of truth; and, I hope, to the
encouragement of the honest hearted. We stayed their first day
meeting, which was large, and proved a trying season; but I was
favoured to relieve my mind among them, although they appeared
too generally insensible of the operation of truth.</p>

<p>After meeting, we rode that afternoon, on our way towards
Lake Champlain, about twelve miles, and attended a meeting at
the house of our friend Joseph Button, that evening, among a
people mostly of the Baptist profession. It was a favoured season,
and ability was received to open many things, in a plain
way, relating to the Christian religion. The strange doctrine
of absolute personal election and reprobation was exposed, also
that of the impossibility of falling from grace; and the true baptism
explained, in opposition to that of water. The next day we
pursued our journey towards Lake Champlain, where we arrived
on second day, and were in the neighbourhood of the lake, in
different towns, for about fifteen days, and attended eleven meetings
among Friends and others, to general satisfaction, and the
peace of my mind.</p>

<p>After this we returned to Danby, and from thence we passed
on, through Queensborough, to Saratoga and Easton; in which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[Pg 37]</span>
neighbourhood we had divers comfortable and edifying meetings,
among Friends and others. Then we went on through Pittstown,
Williamstown, East Hoosack, New Britain, Kline-Kiln,
Coeman’s Patent, crossing the Hudson river on the ice to the last
mentioned place, and from thence to Hudson; most of the way
upon the ice on the river. We had a meeting at each of those
places to good satisfaction, also one at Hudson the next day after
our arrival there. After this we passed on, attending meetings at
Little Nine Partners, and one at the house of our friend Tideman
Hull; thence to the Creek, where we had a precious opportunity
on the first day of the week, in a large meeting of Friends and
others. Then having meetings at Crum-elbow and Oswego,
we got in time to Nine Partners, to attend their preparative meeting
the fifth day following, which proved a comfortable season;
and the next day attended a profitable meeting, appointed at a
place called Chesnut Ridge. The two following days we attended
two meetings, one at the Branch, and the other on the hill at
Oblong; and the day after, their monthly meeting; and returned
to Nine Partners to attend the quarterly meeting, which began
the next day.</p>

<p>The quiet and comfort of this meeting seemed much interrupted
by the forwardness and inexperience of some in the ministry,
which was cause of much affliction to my mind. Oh what
great need there is for those, who apprehend themselves called
to that great and solemn office, to know self wholly reduced; for,
otherwise, there is danger of their endeavouring to clothe themselves
with the Lord’s jewels, which, nevertheless, will turn to
their own shame and confusion. I had some close exercise in
the meeting of Ministers and Elders on that account. On sixth
day we were at the monthly meeting at the Creek, which was
attended with a degree of divine power, but not without suffering
some hurt, by the forward unskilful workmen before mentioned.</p>

<p>From this meeting we crossed the Hudson again, and had
meetings at Little Esopus, Marlborough, and <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Newburg">Newburgh</span> Valley;
and then returned to Nine Partners, and attended their monthly
meeting. After this, taking leave of Friends there, we turned
our faces homewards, having meetings at Amawalk, Joseph<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[Pg 38]</span>
Weeks’ near Salem, Purchase, <span class="correction" title="Apoquage">Apoquague</span>, Mamaroneck, and
Westchester; all favoured seasons, especially the last, which was
mostly composed of those not in membership with Friends. I
was enabled, through divine aid, to open much doctrine to them,
suitable to the occasion, and to the states of those present, to their
general satisfaction; and I felt great peace in my labour, not only
for the service of this meeting, but for all my past labour in this
journey; wherein I had been graciously favoured, to my humbling
admiration. To the Lord only wise, be all the glory.</p>

<p>The next day we rode to New-York, where I lodged with my
kind companion, and was cordially received by his beloved wife,
and many other near and dear friends. We had been from the
city four months and three days. The next day being the first
of the week, I attended their forenoon and afternoon meetings,
which were large; and the day following rode to my own home,
and, with a mind full of peace and solid satisfaction, the sure
reward of obedience, found my dear wife and children all well:
for which favour, also for the manifold unmerited mercies and
preservations I have from time to time received, my spirit bows
in humble adoration before thee, O Lord God of our health
and salvation, and desires to ascribe unto thee greatness, with
glory, thanksgiving, and high renown; for thou art worthy to
receive it, throughout all ages and generations, world without end.
Amen.</p>

<p>I was from home on this journey four months and eleven
days; rode about one thousand five hundred miles, and attended
forty-nine particular meetings among Friends, three quarterly
meetings, six monthly meetings, and forty meetings among other
people.</p>

<p>In the latter end of the 7th month, 1792, I left home, in company
with some other Friends, by appointment from the yearly
meeting of Ministers and Elders, to visit the subordinate meetings
throughout the yearly meeting. I was from home nearly a
month, in which time we visited most of the meetings of Ministers
and Elders, and attended many other meetings; and, I
believe, the visit was truly useful. We had many seasonable
and comfortable opportunities among Friends, and, I trust, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[Pg 39]</span>
labour was blessed to some, and I felt peace of mind for this
little service.</p>

<p>A concern having for some time rested on my mind, in the
feelings of gospel love, to pay a religious visit to Friends in New
England, in the spring of 1793, I opened it to my friends, and
obtained their certificate for that purpose. But I did not proceed
therein till after our yearly meeting. I left home the 2d of 6th
month, being the first of the week, and after attending our own
meeting, I crossed the Sound that afternoon, and got to the
house of our friends Daniel and Samuel Titus at Horseneck,
that evening. Here I met my companion James Mott from
Mamaroneck, who had kindly given up to be my companion in
this journey. We set forward next morning through the state
of Connecticut, which took near three days, and arrived on
fourth day evening at the house of our friend Amos Collins in
Stonington, and the next day attended Friends’ meeting at
Hopkinton, in the state of Rhode Island. From thence we
proceeded on towards Newport, attending meetings in our way,
at Westerly, Richmond, South Kingston, Upper and Lower
House, and Canonnicut Island; all satisfactory opportunities.
After this we crossed the ferry to Newport, and lodged at the
house of our kind and very hospitable friend, the widow Mary
Rodman, who, with her two worthy daughters, Sarah and Hannah,
treated us with great kindness and affection; and where
we continued to lodge, during our stay in that town. The
meeting of Ministers and Elders opened the next day at Portsmouth.
After this we lodged that night at our friend Jacob
Mott’s, and the next day attended a meeting for worship at that
place, which was very large; although things appeared very
low, as to the life and virtue of truth, both among Friends and
others, and lukewarmness and indifference seemed to prevail,
which made it a laborious time for the honest travellers, yet
ability was afforded to discharge myself among them to a good
degree of satisfaction, and peace to my own mind; and we
returned that evening to Newport.</p>

<p>The yearly meeting closed on the third day following; and
although strength was afforded me to discharge myself in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[Pg 40]</span>
several sittings thereof, both for worship and discipline, in a
manner productive of that true peace, which is the sure reward
of a faithful discharge of duty, yet it was, for the most part, a
dull time, and the spring of life seemed very low; occasioned, in
part, as I apprehended, by a very small number taking upon
them the whole management of the business, and thereby shutting
up the way to others, and preventing the free circulation
and spreading of the concern, in a proper manner, on the minds
of Friends; which I have often found to be of very hurtful
tendency.</p>

<p>On fourth day morning we left Newport, and rode to Portsmouth,
and attended their preparative meeting. The forepart
of the meeting for worship was a heavy season, in which it was
my lot to be baptized for the dead; but, as I patiently abode
under suffering with the pure seed, the Lord was pleased to
arise, and give ability to come forth, and sound an alarm to the
lifeless; whereby his power and presence were experienced, in
good measure, to cover the meeting, to the comfort and encouragement
of the living travellers; to the Lord alone be the praise,
who is worthy for ever.</p>

<p>The next day we passed the ferry, and rode to Tiverton, on
the Main, and attended a meeting, by appointment, which was
chiefly made up of people not of our society. Through the
prevalence of divine love, after a season of close labour, strength
was afforded me, largely to open the truths of the gospel, in a
clear manner, greatly to my own satisfaction, and apparently so
to most or all present; for which my spirit was truly thankful.
The next day we attended a meeting at Little Compton, which
was large, and mostly composed of people of other persuasions.
It was a comfortable edifying season; the Lord was graciously
pleased to be near, and to afford wisdom and utterance; many
things were opened in a doctrinal way, suitable to the states of
those present, in the clear demonstration of the spirit, and with
power; in a sense whereof, the living were made to rejoice, and
return thankful acknowledgments for such unmerited mercy.</p>

<p>The day after, we attended the monthly meeting of Friends
of Acoakset, held at Westport; the meeting for worship was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[Pg 41]</span>
very large, and like the former, mostly composed of people of other
persuasions. Ability was afforded me largely to open the nature
of true worship, and to show the fruitlessness of mere outward
performances in religion, without the animating, quickening
virtue of the word of eternal life, influencing and assisting the
soul in that solemn act. The meeting for discipline was small,
and very few of those present appeared to be under right qualifications
to be active in the affairs of the Church; consequently
their business was conducted in great weakness, and in a way
far short of maintaining the proper dignity of a monthly meeting.
No way seemed to open to afford relief; as the disorder
and weakness appeared to be much in those, who assumed the
place of leaders and heads in the meeting, and great and uncommon
rawness in most of the youth. Under the consideration
thereof, my mind was deeply affected with concern for their own,
and the testimony’s, sake.</p>

<p>Our next appointment was at Centre, on first day; and previous
notice having been given of our coming, the meeting was
very large; there were many more than the house could hold,
and it was a precious edifying season. We then rode to Newtown,
taking some refreshment on our way; and attended a
meeting at the fourth hour in the afternoon, which was large,
and proved a satisfactory opportunity, and I felt sweet peace in
this day’s labour.</p>

<p>The next day we attended the monthly meeting of Aponegansett,
alias Dartmouth, which proved a hard, painful season,
things being much out of order with Friends there. Most of the
young people, and some of those that were older, were very raw
and ungoverned; insomuch that the meeting was much interrupted
by an almost continual going in and out, although frequently
reproved for it. It rendered the prospect very afflicting,
to see the professors of truth so regardless of their own reputation
and real good, as well as of the good and reputation of society.
I left this place with a degree of sadness, on account of the prevailing
darkness and ignorance; yet I felt peace to attend my
mind, having faithfully discharged myself among them.</p>

<p>We rode after meeting to New Bedford, in company with our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[Pg 42]</span>
beloved friend Thomas Rotch, who met us at this place; and
we lodged at his house, where we found a cordial reception, and
kind entertainment from him and his beloved wife, who appeared
to be hopeful young Friends. The next day we attended their
monthly meeting, which proved a very comfortable, edifying season.
This monthly meeting was but newly settled, and Friends
appeared desirous of improvement. There were a number of
promising young Friends in this place, to whom my spirit was
nearly united, and a sympathetic travail experienced for their
growth and preservation. My mind was covered with much
sweetness in the course of this meeting, and it proved a time of
revival to my spirit; having experienced much depression and
discouragement in the two foregoing monthly meetings.</p>

<p>The next day we rode to Long Plain, and attended a meeting
at the eleventh hour, which proved, through heavenly help, a
comfortable, edifying season. After this we rode back to Accushnet,
and attended a meeting at the fourth hour that afternoon, in
which I found it my business to set the people an example of
silence; and returned that evening to our lodgings at New Bedford.
The next day we embarked for Nantucket, and arrived
there before night, having sailed about sixty miles in our way
thither. We took our lodgings at the house of our kind friend
Samuel Rodman, and stayed on the island several days, in which
time we attended their monthly meeting, and a meeting of
Ministers and Elders belonging thereto; and two meetings on
the first day of the week. After this, on second and third day,
their quarterly meeting was held, and on fourth day I was at
their meeting held in the middle of the week, in the north meeting-house.
Although things in general were much out of order
with many of the professors of truth in this island, and the pure
seed of the kingdom much oppressed, and gloominess seemed to
spread over the camp, yet the Lord Almighty, in the riches of his
love, was pleased to furnish ability to sound an alarm to the
dead, and to press upon the lukewarm and careless professors,
the necessity of using all diligence to make their calling and
election sure, while time and opportunity were yet graciously
afforded; and also to administer Gilead’s balm, to bind up the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[Pg 43]</span>
broken-hearted, and to encourage the faithful labourers in the
family, to a perseverance in faith and patience. To a remnant
of these, my spirit was nearly united in the real bond of Christian
fellowship, and our hearts were filled with gratitude to the God
and Father of all our sure mercies, that he was graciously pleased
to distil the heavenly dew for refreshing the weary travellers, and
crowning the several meetings with the glorious diadem of his
holy presence; to him alone be the praise, for he is worthy for
ever.</p>

<p>On fifth day, the 4th of 7th month, we left the island, and
crossed over to Falmouth, about forty miles, by water; after
landing, we travelled about four miles to the house of our friend
Richard Lake, and lodged. The next day we attended their
monthly meeting, which proved a time of deep exercise to my
spirit; occasioned, as I believed, by the dead and lifeless state of
the professors of truth in that meeting. I sat through the meeting
for worship in silence, under a great weight of death and
suffering, and saw no way of relief until near the close of the
meeting for discipline, when a prospect opened in my mind, with
a degree of light, to propose to Friends, that the men and women
should sit together again at the close of their business. This
proposition was agreed to by Friends, and way was made to clear
my mind, in a good degree, amongst them, of the burden I had
sat under, in a close searching communication of my prospect
respecting their state, as it opened in the view of my mind. This
appeared to have considerable effect on the minds of some, yet
some others appeared too much in that state, of all others the
most to be dreaded, of self-justification, and of being righteous in
their own eyes, which rendered them indisposed to improvement.</p>

<p>I left that place the day following, with some weight on my
spirit, under a sense of the low state of things among them, and
rode to Yarmouth, and attended a meeting there the next day,
which proved a satisfactory season. The three following days
we passed on through Sandwich, Pembroke, and Boston, to Salem;
having meetings at Sandwich and Pembroke, both, I trust,
profitable edifying seasons to some present. We reached Salem
on fifth day, the 11th of 7th month, just in time to attend their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[Pg 44]</span>
monthly meeting, having rode diligently the morning and afternoon
before to accomplish it; and had a pretty satisfactory time
with Friends at this meeting. After this we rode back to Lynn,
and the next day attended an appointed meeting there, which
proved a large, favoured, and I trust, profitable meeting to many,
not soon to be forgotten; there were a considerable number of
hopeful young people in this place. In the afternoon, we had a
precious opportunity at a Friend’s house, where there were a
number of young people and others collected; it was a heart-tendering
season. For this, with other favours conferred from
time to time, my heart was made truly thankful to the Father of
mercies, and God of all comfort, who is over all, blessed for ever.</p>

<p>We proceeded the next day to Almsbury, and lodged with our
friend Ezekiel Jones, and the next morning rode back to Newbury,
and attended Friends’ meeting at the eleventh hour. Although
the meeting was small, Friends being much reduced
there, yet some of the neighbouring people coming in we had a
precious opportunity together, to our mutual comfort; the way
of life and salvation being clearly opened to them, in the demonstration
of the spirit, and with power; for which my spirit was
reverently thankful. We rode back and attended a meeting at
Almsbury that afternoon, at the fourth hour; a large number of
those, who were not members of our society, assembled with the
few Friends of that place, insomuch that the house could not contain
them. It proved a painful season, by reason of the prevailing
death and darkness that seemed to spread, not only over Friends,
but the assembly in general. My spirit was brought into a state
of deep suffering and baptism, but as I patiently endured the
conflict, way was made, and ability afforded, to open to them
their states and conditions, with the necessity of being redeemed
therefrom, and the way whereby it must be effected. The people
were generally solid, and I trust it was a profitable season to
many minds present.</p>

<p>We returned that evening to the house of our friend Ezekiel
Jones, and the next day proceeded to Newtown, where we had a
meeting, which proved, I trust, an instructive edifying season to
some present; although the life of religion appeared very low in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[Pg 45]</span>
that place. We lodged here, and the day following we went to
Halestown alias Wear, and took our lodgings at the house of our
friend Ebenezer Breed. We attended their monthly meeting
next day; things in general appeared in a low state with Friends
here, much of which weakness I apprehended arose from these
two causes. First, from a forward spirit, which appeared very
predominant in some members, who were not under a right
qualification to be active in meetings for discipline, not having
their spirits sanctified: and their unseasoned offerings and forward
activity were a great burden to the living concerned members,
being often opposed to the right exercise of discipline, which
caused divisions and parties in the meeting: Secondly, those
Friends who seemed to have the cause of truth at heart, for
want of dwelling enough in the root, and in that perfect love
that casts out all fear, were led from an apprehension of necessity,
in order to keep down those forward spirits, to make use of some
undue methods in the exercise of discipline. This, originating
in fear, and being the result of human contrivance, instead of
subjecting, had a tendency to strengthen them, in their opposition:
for nothing can promote the Lord’s work but his own peaceable
spirit and wisdom, and this stands out of all human consultation
and contrivance, which, when given way to, although ever so
well intended, always mar his work. I was much exercised,
both in the meeting for worship, and that for discipline; and I
was helped to administer much counsel and advice for Friends’
improvement in general, and particularly that those before mentioned
difficulties might be removed; and felt much peace in my
labour.</p>

<p>The next day, being the 5th of the week, and 19th of 7th
month, we rode to Epping, about forty-two miles, and lodged with
our friend Joshua Fulsome, an approved minister, and attended
Friends’ meeting there the following day. In the forepart of this
meeting, my mind was reduced into such a state of great weakness
and depression, that my faith was almost ready to fail, which
produced great searchings of heart, so that I was led to call in
question all that I had ever before experienced. In this state of
doubting, I was ready to wish myself at home, from an appre<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[Pg 46]</span>hension
that I should only expose myself to reproach, and wound
the cause I was embarked in; for the heavens seemed like brass,
and the earth as iron; such coldness and hardness, I thought
could scarcely have ever been experienced before by any creature,
so great was the depth of my baptism at this time; nevertheless,
as I endeavoured to quiet my mind, in this conflicting dispensation,
and be resigned to my allotment, however distressing,
towards the latter part of the meeting a ray of light broke through
the surrounding darkness, in which the Shepherd of Israel was
pleased to arise, and by the light of his glorious countenance, to
scatter those clouds of opposition. Then ability was received,
and utterance given, to speak of his marvellous works in the
redemption of souls, and to open the way of life and salvation,
and the mysteries of his glorious kingdom, which are hid from
the wise and prudent of this world, and revealed only unto those,
who are reduced into the state of little children and babes in
Christ. It proved a time of renewed strength and consolation to
myself, and I trust it was so to many present. Renowned for
ever be the name of the Lord, who hath his way in the cloud,
and in the thick darkness, and who can cause the light to shine
out of obscurity, when he pleaseth, for the comfort and help of
his devoted children, and cause their darkness to become as the
noonday.</p>

<p>We passed on from thence through Dover to Berwick, where
the monthly meeting for Dover was held the next day. It
proved a very exercising season, great weakness attending the
meeting, on account of the same rending, dividing spirit getting
in among Friends there, mentioned at the foregoing monthly
meeting at Wear. It had made great havoc among them; a
great number of members had been separated, and others were
about to be separated, by minutes of denial from the monthly
meeting. I had some close labour with them, not only by endeavouring
to stir up and warn the careless and refractory members;
but I also found it necessary to caution and warn those,
who had the chief management of discipline. I believed they
had too much departed from the meek spirit of Jesus, in ordering
the affairs of truth; and instead of giving the right portion of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[Pg 47]</span>
meat in due season to their fellow members, had given way to a
spirit of impatience, and therefore did not stand wholly clear of
beating and abusing their fellow servants. O how necessary it
is for all those, who think themselves called to be active in the
discipline of the Church, to know their own spirits fully subjected,
that nothing of the unmortified will of the creature may be found
acting in the work of the Lord; or mixing its own forward
unsanctified zeal, with that true and holy fervour of soul, which
animates, quickens, and constrains, by the mere force and influence
of the pure love of Christ, our holy head, and heavenly
high priest, from whence it derives all its power and authority,
in putting right discipline in practice, and laying true judgment
on the head of transgressors, and refractory members. We tarried
here the next day, it being the first of the week. The meeting
was pretty large, and was composed of Friends and others,
and favoured with the reachings forth of heavenly regard, consoling
many hearts, and refreshing the weary travellers; of
these, there appeared to be a small remnant preserved in almost
every place. The meeting ended with humble supplication, and
praise to the great Author of every blessing, who is over all,
worthy for ever.</p>

<p>The next day, the 22d of 7th month, we proceeded on towards
Falmouth, at Casco Bay, attending a meeting at Portland, in
our way thither. On fourth day we attended the monthly meeting
of Falmouth, and, on sixth day, the monthly meeting of
Durham; they were in general satisfactory seasons. The next
day we rode to Georgetown, and attended a meeting appointed
there at the eleventh hour. After this we proceeded on to the
widow Gardner’s, in a town called Bordingham; in getting to
this place, we had to cross the great river Kennebeck twice. The
next day, being the first of the week, and the 28th of 7th month,
a large meeting was held there by our appointment, there being
no meeting in that place. It was a time of hard labour for a
season, by reason of the indifference and ignorance of many
present; nevertheless, ability was afforded to discharge myself
among them, to pretty good satisfaction, and, I believe, generally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[Pg 48]</span>
so to those present; and, I trust, by some, the season will not
soon be forgotten.</p>

<p>We went by water that afternoon up the aforesaid river, about
seven miles, to the house of our friend George Ramsdale, having
sent our horses there the night before. The next day we passed
on to Vassalborough, and the day following rode up the river to
Fairfield, and attended a meeting, and returned to Vassalborough
that afternoon. The next day we attended Friends’ meeting
there, which proved a heavy dull season, till near the close, when
ability was afforded me to clear myself among them, in a close
searching communication, which appeared to have a good effect,
and the meeting ended well.</p>

<p>We passed on that afternoon twenty miles to Winthrop, and
the next day had a meeting there. After this we rode to Greene,
and from thence to Lewistown, having a meeting at each place;
both precious heart-tendering seasons, especially the latter, which
was attended by a large number of young people, many of whom
were greatly affected by the power of truth. We left them in
a tender loving frame of mind, and rode that afternoon to Durham.
The next day, being the first of the week, and 4th of
8th month, we attended Friends’ meeting there, in which I was
favoured to open many things in a doctrinal way, there being
many present, who were not in membership with Friends. I was
likewise led to speak largely of the good effects of pure love.</p>

<p>We passed on from thence through Falmouth to Portland,
where we had a meeting appointed for the town’s people; it was
held in their court-house, and was, through heavenly help, an
instructive season. Many doctrines of the gospel were clearly
opened; and the unsound doctrines of original sin and predestination,
also the schemes of the Universalists, Atheists, and
Deists, were confuted from scripture and reason. And a pressing
exhortation was extended to all present, to attend to the leadings
of the spirit of Christ in their own hearts, so as to be sensible of
their fallen condition, and to become acquainted with the necessity,
means, and manner of their salvation. Truth was over all,
and I had great peace in my labour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>We returned that evening to Falmouth, and the next day
went to Windham, and attended a meeting, wherein I was led
to be an example of silence. After this we rode to the house of
our friend John Robinson, and lodged; and a prospect opening
for paying another visit to Friends at Wear, we accordingly proceeded,
attending meetings in our way, at Gorham, Lymington,
New Sandwich, and Gilmantown, all satisfactory seasons; and
reached Wear in time to attend their monthly meeting. Although
the same dividing spirit was still discernible among them, which
produced much weakness, yet we had pretty good satisfaction in
our visit. We proceeded from thence through Pittsfield, and
Lee, in our way to Dover, having a meeting at each place, and
reached Dover in time to attend their monthly meeting, held on
seventh day, the 17th of 8th month. Although discipline is at
a low ebb with Friends here, yet, through divine condescension,
I hope the season was profitable and instructive to many present.
We were at their first day meeting in the forenoon; and, in the
afternoon, had a satisfactory meeting at Kittery; and, on second
day, we attended meetings at Madersborough, and Rochester,
both, I trust, profitable seasons. On third day we rode to Hampton,
and the next day had a comfortable meeting with Friends of
that place; and from thence we returned to Salem, and attended
a meeting. Then we proceeded to Lynn, and attended their
forenoon and afternoon meetings on first day. On second day
we rode to Boston, and attended a meeting at the eleventh hour;
although the meeting was but small, there being but very few
Friends in that place, and only a small number of the town’s
people came in, yet we had pretty good satisfaction in giving
them this opportunity, and way opened to clear ourselves among
them. After this we passed on, having a meeting at Taunton,
and then attended Providence monthly meeting, held at Smithfield;
things appeared but low with Friends of this monthly
meeting, their attention being too much turned to worldly concerns.
We next attended the monthly meeting held in the upper
part of Smithfield, being about nine miles from the latter; this
was in general a satisfactory season; and the following day we
attended Uxbridge monthly meeting, to good satisfaction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>Our next appointment was at Freetown, the first of the week,
and the 1st of 9th month, and was a satisfactory opportunity;
and, on second day, we attended the monthly meeting at Swansey;
here things appeared much out of order, and in a low state;
but, through divine favour, ability was given me, to clear my mind
among them, in a way, that I hope, will tend to their profit.
From thence we passed on to Providence, where we had a satisfactory
meeting. The four following days we had meetings at
Cranston, Greenwich, Foster and Scituate; all satisfactory meetings,
particularly the last; it was an open edifying season, many
hearts being comforted by the power of truth, which prevailed
over all, and was cause of deep thankfulness to my mind. Our
next meeting was at Wankeg, on first day, the 8th of 9th
month; it was a profitable edifying season. Then passing on, we
had meetings as they were laid out for us, on second day at Gloucester,
on third day at Douglass, and on fourth day at Smithfield.
The last was a large meeting, and many things were opened in
a clear manner; confuting that dark belief in election and
reprobation, and the impossibility of falling from grace. Also
showing the necessity of regeneration, through the operation of
the one essential baptism of the Holy Ghost; and that all were
the objects of universal, and saving grace, and how all might be
saved by it, if they did not reject it to their own destruction.</p>

<p>The next day we attended a meeting at Mendham; it was a
comfortable season to myself, and I believe, to most or all present,
and was cause of thankful remembrance. From thence we passed
on, having meetings at Northbridge, Bolton and Leicester; at
this place we also attended a burial, and had a favoured opportunity
with the people. Then we went to Richmond, and attended
their monthly meeting, where things were much out of order,
and the meeting was small, and in a weak situation. I cleared
my mind in a plain way among them, and found peace therein.</p>

<p>This was the last meeting we attended in the compass of
Rhode Island yearly meeting. Then we passed on into the
state of Vermont, in order to visit Friends of our own yearly
meeting, who resided in that state. We reached Sharon, in time
to attend their meeting on first day, the 22d of 9th month; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[Pg 51]</span>
the next day attended a meeting at Strafford, which was a dull
heavy time, in which I found it my place to be silent. The next
day we crossed Connecticut river to the town of Hanover, and
attended a meeting in a school-house, no Friends living in those
parts. It was a satisfactory season. We lodged with a man
attached to Friends, of the name of John Williams, who with his
wife, were convinced of the principles of truth; yet found it a
great trial, faithfully to take up the cross, as they lived among a
people much opposed to them in that respect. We left them the
next day in a tender frame of mind, and I have a hope they will
improve. We returned over the river and attended a meeting in
the town of Norwich, at the fourth hour of the afternoon, which
was a small, but favoured meeting. We lodged that night with
a person who had requested to be joined to Friends, of the name
of Zebulon Huntington. The next morning we returned to
Sharon, and attended a meeting at the eleventh hour, it being
their usual meeting day, which was a favoured season. The next
day we attended a meeting in the northeast part of the town of
Strafford, among those not of our society. After this we set forward
for Lake Champlain, and got to <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Ferrisburg">Ferrisburgh</span> just in time to attend
their meeting on first day, the 29th of 9th month, which I sat in
silence; and returned after meeting to the house of our friend
Nicholas Holmes and lodged. The next day we rode to our friend
Cornelius Halbert’s, and attended a meeting at the fourth hour,
which proved a comfortable season: it was mostly composed of
those not in membership with us.</p>

<p>From thence we proceeded to Grand Isle, which is situated
nearly in the middle of Lake Champlain, having a meeting at
Wiltston, in our way thither. We had a comfortable meeting at
our lodgings at this place, and then crossed over by water to the
west side of the lake, to the river Sable. We walked on foot
about six miles near this river, to the house of our friend Richard
Keese, where we had a satisfactory opportunity, in a meeting
appointed in his house. It was a newly settled place, and no
meeting of Friends within forty miles. We returned then to
Grand Isle, and the next day, the first of the week, and the 6th
of 10th month, we attended another meeting there, and then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[Pg 52]</span>
returned to Monkton, to the house of our kind friend Nicholas
Holmes, who had accompanied us in this little tour to the northward.
We rested the next day, and the day following had an
appointed meeting at the house of my kinsman Stephen Haight.
On fifth day we had a comfortable opportunity with Friends
here, at their preparative meeting. After this we took leave of
our friends of this place, and rode to Vergennes, and lodged at our
friend Thomas Robinson’s; and the next day proceeded on our
way to Queensbury, where we arrived on seventh day evening.
The day after, the first of the week, and the 13th of 10th month,
we attended two meetings; the first, at Friends’ meeting-house,
at the usual time; and the latter, at a Friend’s house, where a
considerable number of people, who were not in profession with
us, assembled.</p>

<p>On second day we rode to Easton, and lodged at our friend
William Coffin’s; on third day, it being rainy weather, we rested;
and on fourth day, we attended the preparative meeting of
Ministers and Elders for Easton monthly meeting. On fifth
day their monthly meeting began, which held three days, and, in
general, was conducted to good satisfaction. I felt near sympathy
with Friends of this place, as their monthly meeting was
bordering on an extensive newly settled country, to which Friends
were moving from various parts. It made the bounds of their
meeting very wide, and the members much scattered from one
another; and caused much labour and exercise to the concerned
part of the meeting, in attending to, and conducting the affairs
of truth. It likewise occasioned them to have, almost continually,
a great load of business before the monthly meeting. The day
after, being the first of the week, we attended a meeting at Saratoga.
It was a large comfortable edifying meeting, and very
refreshing to my spirit, which had been much exhausted by the
exercise and labour of the three foregoing days.</p>

<p>In the course of this week we attended meetings at Greenfield,
Ballstown, Troy, Albany, and Coeman’s Patent; and reached
Hudson on seventh day evening. The next day, the first of the
week, and 27th of 10th month, we attended their morning meeting,
and then proceeded on, being desirous of reaching the quar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[Pg 53]</span>terly
meeting at Oblong, which began on third day. We arrived
there on second day evening, where we met with several beloved
friends from near our own homes, to our mutual comfort. After
the close of this meeting, we proceeded directly home; where I
arrived the 2d of 11th month, and found my dear wife and
family in a pretty good state of health, to our mutual rejoicing.
I had renewed cause to bless the name of the Lord for his preserving
providence and mercy, who is over all, worthy for ever.</p>

<p>I was from home in this journey about five months, and travelled
by land and water about two thousand two hundred and
eighty-three miles; having visited all the meetings of Friends in
the New England states, and many meetings amongst those of
other professions; and also visited many meetings, among
Friends and others, in the upper part of our own yearly meeting;
and found real peace in my labours.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</h2>


<p class="chap-head">Visit to the Meetings of Ministers and Elders, 1795.&mdash;Visit to Friends in Pennsylvania,
New-Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia, 1798.</p>


<p>On the 26th of 7th month, 1795, I left home in order to
join a committee of Friends, appointed by the yearly meeting
of Ministers and Elders this year, to visit the quarterly and preparative
meetings, and Friends individually, in those stations,
throughout the yearly meeting. A concern having arisen in
that meeting, occasioned by the many obvious <span class="correction" title="In the original book: deficiences">deficiencies</span> and
departures amongst us as a people, from the purity and simplicity
of our holy profession, a minute was issued and recommended
to the inferior meetings, setting forth the ground of this concern,
and for the purpose of stirring up and encouraging Friends to
a diligent search and labour, that the many hurtful disorders
might be removed, and a right reformation, from those prevailing
weaknesses, effectually take place.</p>

<p>This being the first day of the week, I sat with Friends in
their meeting at Westbury; and although it was a dull time in
the forepart, yet, through the comforting assistance of heavenly
help, it was made, I believe, an edifying season to many minds.
I crossed the Sound that afternoon to New Rochelle, and the next
morning met some of the committee at the house of our friend
Hugh Judge. We had an opportunity with his family, which
proved a refreshing season, it being evident that he, and his wife,
joined heartily with the concern. We visited several other families
that day, and had the satisfaction to believe, that the concern
and labour were owned by the Head of the Church, and, we
believe, will be blessed to many.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>The next day the quarterly meeting at Purchase began, and
through the several sittings was made, I trust, a profitable season;
it ended on fifth day. The next day we had opportunities with
two families, which, through the fresh extendings of holy help,
proved very instructive and encouraging. After this we set out
for Nine Partners, their quarterly meeting coming in the ensuing
week. I reached there on first day morning, the 2d of 8th
month, and attended their meeting, which proved a heart searching
season, it being too manifest that many professors had suffered
their minds to be captivated by a worldly spirit, which had
introduced great death and darkness into our meetings, to the
grief and trouble of the honest-hearted. But help was graciously
afforded me to set forth, in a plain manner, the danger attending
such a departure from the life and power of religion; and to
stir up also the lukewarm from their supineness and ease, and
enforce the necessity of a more full dedication of their hearts, and
their all, to the Lord’s service.</p>

<p>The next day we attended the preparative meeting of Ministers
and Elders at the Creek, in which much weakness was
apparent. The three following days we attended the quarterly
meeting at Nine Partners; on the last of which, I was favoured
to relieve my mind among them, in a season of close
searching labour, by way of communication. After this we proceeded
towards Easton, to attend the quarterly meeting there,
and to visit the families of Ministers and Elders within the compass
of that meeting, which we performed in about a week.
Although weakness seemed to abound with Friends there,
yet we were comforted in believing, that the visit had a profitable
effect, and afforded encouragement, and a renewal of strength,
to the sincere-hearted.</p>

<p>On seventh day, the 15th of 8th month, we rode to East
Hoosac, and the next day attended Friends’ meeting there, which
was large, many people of other societies attending. It proved
an open satisfactory time, and ended under a renewed sense of
the merciful extendings of holy condescending love; for which,
I trust, many minds were made humbly thankful. The afternoon
and next morning were passed in visiting the families of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[Pg 56]</span>
Ministers and Elders; and although things were not all well
among them, yet we had satisfaction and peace in our own
minds, by a faithful discharge of the trust committed to us.
The next day we rode to New Britain, and visited a Friend in
the ministry there, he being the only select member in that meeting.
From thence we passed on to Kline-Kiln, where there was
likewise but one member of the select meeting, an Elder, whom
we visited. We then went to Coeman’s Patent, where there were
three select members, to whom we paid a satisfactory visit, and
then proceeded to the city of Hudson. The evening after our
arrival, and the next day, we had opportunities with the Ministers
and Elders of that place. They proved seasons of heart-searching
labour, things appearing much out of order with some of them;
and, among these, there was a disposition apparent, to lay waste
good order in the Church. O the great want of honest, faithful
labourers in the vineyard.</p>

<p>After our services were finished here, we left them with the
answer of peace, and rode that afternoon to Nine Partners. The
next day we attended Friends’ meeting at Stanford, which proved
a season of hard labour. There was a great want of solid weight,
and a living travail, in order to experience the renewals of
strength; the power of truth went forth freely, for the stirring up,
and arousing the careless and supine from their beds of ease.
After this we visited two families of Friends, and, the two following
days, finished our visit to the rest of the families of Ministers
and Elders in Creek monthly meeting. The rest of the week
was taken up in visiting those under the notice of our appointment,
in the monthly meeting of Nine Partners; and I may
truly say, it was, in general, a sorrowful affecting time, in beholding
the great departure of many of the Ministers and Elders, in
their families, from that faithful discharge of duty, which their
stations require; for want of this, their children had almost all
gone out from plainness. We endeavoured to lay before them,
in sincerity and simplicity of heart, the great danger attending
such a conduct, and the necessity of a reform in those things; and
felt peace of mind in our labour.</p>

<p>On seventh day afternoon we rode to Marlborough, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[Pg 57]</span>
attended Friends’ meeting there the next day; it was an exercising
season, on account of the great rawness and inexperience
of the members of the meeting too generally, and the great
lightness manifest, in most of those of other societies, a number
of whom were present. My mind, after a time of hard
labour, and suffering with the seed, was engaged in some
service addressed to the latter class. Afterwards way opened to
have Friends select, to whom my mind was led to communicate
some things in a plain way, with the view of stirring them up to
more diligence and circumspection in their families, the better
ordering and disciplining of their children and household, and
keeping things sweet and clean, agreeably to the simplicity of
our holy profession; and I had peace in my labour. That afternoon,
and the two following days, we visited all the families of
Ministers and Elders in that monthly meeting, except one. After
this I returned home, and found my family as well as usual;
which I esteemed as a favour from my great and good Master.
For this, with all his other mercies and preservations dispensed
from time to time, I felt a return of thankfulness and grateful
acknowledgment to Him, who is the author and giver of every
good and perfect gift, and “who is over all, God blessed for ever.”</p>

<p>Having for several years felt my mind drawn, at times, in gospel
love, to visit Friends of the yearly meetings of Pennsylvania,
New-Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and some parts of Virginia,
in the fall of the year 1797, apprehending the time to be nigh for
the performance of the visit, I laid my concern before Friends
of the monthly and quarterly meetings of which I was a member;
and received certificates of their unity and concurrence. I
left home the 12th of 12th month, accompanied by Joseph
Cooper, a member of our meeting, in the station of an Elder;
taking leave of my family and friends, we rode to New-York,
and the meeting for sufferings sitting there the next day, I
attended it; and the day following being the meeting day for
Friends of that city, I felt most easy to stay and attend it, which
proved a comfortable strengthening season. After this I took
leave of my friends there, parting from them in near unity and
brotherly affection, and passed the next morning by water to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[Pg 58]</span>
Staten Island. The day following we had two meetings there,
and though small by reason of rain, were, nevertheless, both
attended with a comfortable degree of divine favour. The next
day we left the island and rode to Shrewsbury; and the day
after, being first day, we sat with Friends there, and, I trust, it
was a profitable season to some present, and relieving to my own
mind; strength and utterance being furnished to open divers
truths of the gospel, in the demonstration of the spirit, accompanied
with a good degree of the divine power; to God only wise
be the praise, who is over all, worthy for ever.</p>

<p>On second day we attended a meeting at a Friend’s house about
seven miles from Shrewsbury, on our way to Squan. On third
and fourth days we were at Squan and Squancum, both small
meetings, as there are but few of our society in those parts; yet
they were, for the most part, satisfactory seasons. We also sat
with Friends in their preparative meeting in the latter place,
which appeared in a state of great weakness; but as way opened,
I was led to make some remarks, in order to stir Friends up
to more diligence and circumspection; and to show the necessity
of an inward travail for the arising of truth, which can only
qualify for the right ordering of the affairs of society. The next
day we rode to Barnegat, and after an opportunity with Friends
there the following day, we passed on to Little Eggharbour,
where we remained till first day, the 24th of the month. Notice
being spread of our intention of attending Friends’ meeting there,
many of the neighbouring inhabitants came in, and sat with
Friends, and were very attentive; divers truths of the gospel
were opened in the clear demonstration of the spirit, and I was
helped to leave them with a peaceful mind. On the 25th we
rode to Great Eggharbour, and the three following days attended
meetings at the upper and lower meeting-houses of Friends there,
also an appointed meeting near the head of Great Eggharbour
river, at a place called Stephens’ Creek; they were generally
small, yet attended with a good degree of favour; for which my
spirit was made humbly thankful. On sixth day we attended a
meeting at Cape May, which, through the gracious condescension
of the Shepherd of Israel, was made a truly comfortable season,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[Pg 59]</span>
and His great name magnified and praised, who is worthy for
ever.</p>

<p>From thence we rode to Morris’ river, and attended a meeting
appointed at the house of Isaac Buzby, a man inclining to Friends.
The spirit of truth favoured me with wisdom and utterance, to
divide the word suitably to the states of those present; and apparently
to their and to my own satisfaction and comfort. We
rode that afternoon to the house of a Friend of the name of
Henry Rulon, where we had an appointed meeting the next
day. After this we passed on to Greenwich, and the two following
days attended a meeting there, and one at the head of
Cohansy Creek. Then we rode to the house of our kind friend
Mark Miller, at Salem, and rested the next day. The day
following, being the first of the week, and 7th of 1st month, we
attended the meeting there, which was very large, many coming
in that were not members; the power of truth was exalted over
all, to the comfort of many hearts, and to the praise and glory of
Him, who is the strength and help of his dependent children.
On second day we attended a meeting at Woodstown; I was
closely engaged among them in a searching testimony, pointing
out the great danger, and hurtful tendency of the want of unity,
and joining in with the spirit of the world, and neglecting a right
conformity to the wholesome order, established among us, as a
religious society; whereby many disorders had crept in, wounding
to many: strength was afforded me, and utterance given,
and truth exalted over all opposition and disorderly spirits. The
four following days we attended meetings at Penn’s Neck, Mullica
Hill, Upper Greenwich, and Woodbury; they were all
seasons of favour, especially the last, where truth was eminently
exalted, and the doctrines of the gospel held forth in the demonstration
of the spirit; and the hearts of the faithful were made
to rejoice in a sense of the Lord’s goodness, to whom belongs the
praise of his own work for ever.</p>

<p>On seventh day we rested with our esteemed friend Joshua
Evens; and on first day attended Newtown meeting, and the
day following, that at Haddonfield, both of which were profitable
edifying meetings. In the afternoon, after the latter meeting,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[Pg 60]</span>
we crossed the river Delaware to Philadelphia, and the three
following days attended the three meetings in that city; they
were all opportunities of favour, and I had much satisfaction in
this short visit to Friends of this place. I was comforted in the
experience of an open door among them, both in meetings and in
families where my lot was cast; and I felt my spirit nearly united
to a living remnant, especially a number of the beloved youth, who
are under the forming hand, preparing for service; some of
whom, I trust and believe, will be as valiants in their day, for
the promotion of the cause of truth and righteousness in the
earth. May the Lord bless, and keep them faithful to himself,
and cover their heads in the day of battle.</p>

<p>On sixth day, the 19th of 1st month, we left the city in order
to attend a meeting at Darby, notice having gone before of our
intention; it proved an open time, but the meeting was hurt by
an indiscreet appearance towards the end, which clothed my
spirit with sorrow, not only on the Friends’ account, but especially
on account of the people, for whose information and religious
instruction, my mind had been closely engaged. We rode
that afternoon to Chester, and the next day attended a meeting
there, which was owned with manifestations of divine favour;
and I was instructed to hand out doctrine, suitable to the states
of the people present. After this we rode to Wilmington; and
the next day, being the first of the week, and the 21st of 1st
month, we attended their forenoon and afternoon meetings. I
was silent in the first; but, through the merciful assistance of the
Shepherd of Israel, the latter proved a comfortable strengthening
season; after a time of close exercise in silent labour, and deep
baptism into death and suffering with the seed, the power of
truth went forth with authority against many things that opened
to view, as the cause of that deep oppression of the seed of life
among them; the meeting ended under a sense of the Lord’s
goodness, and many hearts were made to rejoice.</p>

<p>The six following days we attended meetings at Whiteclay
Creek, Appoquinamink, Duck Creek, Little Creek, Motherkill,
and Camden, which is a village where no meeting of Friends is
held; things appeared low in most of them, as to the life of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[Pg 61]</span>
religion. But, through the condescending goodness of the Shepherd
of Israel, I had an open door among them, and many gospel
truths were held forth, in the clear demonstration of the
spirit, and with power; the last, especially, was a time thankfully
to be remembered by me, and, I believe, by many others
present; thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift, that he is
not leaving himself without a witness in the hearts of the people.
The next day, first of the week, we attended Millford meeting;
things appeared very low, and but few of our society in that part,
and those appeared very indifferent, and several of them were
absent. On second day we attended a meeting at Cool Spring,
and the next day attended an appointed meeting on our way
towards Third Haven; it was held in a Friend’s house, who
had lately been received a member, and who before was a professor
with the people called Nicholites; he appeared to be a
pretty solid man. The meeting was in a good degree favoured;
the way of preparation, as held forth in John’s dispensation, for
the more full manifestation of the gospel state, was set forth,
with the nature of true Christian or spiritual baptism; and that
John’s baptism was only a figure thereof, and, therefore, was no
part of Christ’s baptism, and, consequently, had no place in, nor
could be of any use under, the dispensation of the gospel. The
people appeared generally satisfied, and I parted with them in
peace of mind.</p>

<p>The six following days we attended meetings at North West
Fork, Marshy Creek, Centre, Greensborough, Tuckahoe Neck,
and Tuckahoe; and, although these meetings were attended by
but few of those who were joined in fellowship with us, yet they
were mostly crowded full meetings, many of the neighbouring
inhabitants coming in, divers of whom were holders of slaves,
and others very raw and ignorant. My spirit was much exercised
in travail among them, being <span class="correction" title="In the original book: baptised">baptized</span> into their low and
uncultivated states; nevertheless, through the merciful interference
of the Shepherd of Israel, their lost and undone condition,
without a Saviour, was clearly laid open before them; also the
way of return, reconciliation, and salvation. Many present were
aroused and reached by the power of truth, which was graciously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[Pg 62]</span>
prevalent in most of these meetings; their spirits greatly tendered,
and the few faithful among them were made to rejoice; and
my spirit was humbly thankful, in a sense of the Lord’s goodness;
to him alone be the praise; nothing due to man.</p>

<p>Three of the above meetings were held in meeting-houses belonging
to a people under the denomination of Nicholites; many
of them were led into great self-denial, particularly in regard to
dress and household furniture. They appeared one in principle
with us, their faith and doctrine being founded on the manifestation
and influence of the divine light, inwardly revealed. Most of
them, of late, have requested to be joined in membership with
Friends, and have been received. Many of them appear to be a
worthy people; yet, I fear, some were a little hurt by being too
tenacious in their dress, particularly in making it a point to have
all parts of their clothing white. Yet, in general, they appeared
to be a plain innocent upright-hearted people; and I felt a concern
lest they should be hurt by the great and prevailing deficiencies
manifest amongst us, by many turning away from the purity and
simplicity of our holy self-denying profession. This, I believe,
is a subject worthy of the deep consideration of those delinquent
brethren. For if it be a truth, as most certainly it is, that whosoever
offendeth one of the least of those who believe in Christ, it
were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck,
and he cast into the sea; what will become of those, who live in
the daily practice of those things, which give continual offence to
their brethren, and are stumbling blocks in the way of honest
inquirers.</p>

<p>After attending the aforesaid meetings, we passed on, having
meetings at Choptank, Third Haven and Bayside, on the eastern
shore of Maryland. The two first were attended by many of
other societies, a number of whom were Methodists, and at each
was one of their ministers; both of whom were very solid, and
paid great attention; one of them was much affected, and wept
freely for a considerable time; and, with divers others, manifested
their full satisfaction. My spirit was much humbled, and made
to rejoice in the Lord, that he was graciously near, and made
bare his arm for our help, and carried us through the exercise of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[Pg 63]</span>
those meetings, to the honour of his own name, who is over all,
worthy for ever.</p>

<p>After leaving Bayside, we attended a meeting which we had
appointed the day before, on our way thither, at a village called
St. Michael’s, among the Methodists; the people were nearly all
of that profession in this place. It was held in their meeting-house,
and was the first meeting appointed by any Friend in
that place, except a small one by some women Friends some
years before. There was, at this time, a general collection;
and, considering their unacquaintance with us, and our manner
of sitting in silence, they behaved pretty well. A comfortable
degree of the divine presence was witnessed, and many minds
tendered and comforted, and divers gospel truths clearly opened
to the apparent satisfaction of most present.</p>

<p>We left them with peace of mind, and the next day attended
a meeting at Easton, alias Third Haven, among the black people,
which we had appointed some days before. It proved a
favoured opportunity, and to the edification, comfort, and encouragement
of this poor, injured, and too much despised people;
many of whom, I believe, have good desires begotten in their
minds after the knowledge of the truth.</p>

<p>The next day, the first of the week, and the 11th of 2d month,
we attended Friends’ meeting at this place, and information of
our intention of being here having been given before, the neighbouring
inhabitants generally came in, so that the house was
much crowded. The gospel was largely and freely preached
among them, to the apparent satisfaction of all present. How
marvellous is thy loving kindness, O Lord, to the workmanship
of thy holy hand; how art thou graciously holding out, from
season to season, offers of reconciliation to thy revolting and
rebellious children, and art calling to them, by thy servants, now,
as formerly, return, return, repent and live; for why will ye die, O
house of Israel, saith your God. We continued here and attended
their meeting of Ministers and Elders; and, on fifth day, their
monthly meeting, which was in some degree favoured; divers
things were opened for the improvement and encouragement of
Friends in well ordering the affairs of truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>The day following we rode to Chester, and the next day
attended Friends’ monthly meeting at Cecil, which was small;
but truth favoured me with ability to labour, to stir up Friends
to more vigilance, and careful waiting for the arising of the
spring of life; as nothing short of the divine power, and renewed
quickenings of the holy spirit, can qualify for the promotion of
good order and discipline in the Church. The next day, the
first of the week, we attended the meeting here. Notice having
been given to the neighbouring inhabitants, many came in, most
of whom appeared very raw and light; nevertheless, as Friends
kept down to their exercise, towards the close of the meeting,
truth came into dominion; and all that opposed it was made to
bow and acknowledge its power; for which my spirit was made
thankful to the Author of every blessing. On second and third
days following, we attended two meetings; the first, in Friends’
meeting-house at Chester, and the latter at Chestertown in their
court-house; both pretty large meetings, and overshadowed with
the wing of divine power; although, in the latter meeting, we
had to arrive at it through deep baptism, and suffering with the
seed; for those that reign with Christ, must be willing likewise
to suffer. The people, in the forepart, were very light, often
whispering one to the other; a spirit of licentiousness appeared to
be prevalent with many of them; but as truth arose, they were
gradually subjected, until a becoming solemnity appeared in
almost every countenance. I trust some good was effected in
some minds; but we must leave the event to the Lord, to whom
alone belongs all the praise; nothing due to man, but blushing
and confusion of face.</p>

<p>The next day we attended a meeting at the head of Chester;
it was somewhat hurt, in the forepart, for want of room. The
house was not sufficient to contain all who came, and the
weather too cold to stand without; yet, as it settled into quiet, it
proved a precious baptizing season, and many hearts were melted
into deep contrition. I had cause to hope that if the few Friends
in that place show forth a good example, there will be some
gathered. The day following we attended the meeting at Sassafras,
to pretty good satisfaction. The next day we rode to East<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[Pg 65]</span>
Nottingham, and attended their monthly meeting the day after;
it proved a very exercising meeting, things being much out of
order among them. I was led forth in a line of close searching
labour, both in testimony in the first part of the meeting, and
likewise in that for discipline; but I got little relief, except from
a consciousness, in myself, of having discharged my duty faithfully
among them. The next day, the first of the week, and
25th of 2d month, we attended their particular meeting; in which
I had to expose, in a close, arousing testimony, that spirit among
Friends, which pleads for joining with those active in civil government,
and taking part therein, and adopting the maxims and
spirit of the world. Truth reigned triumphantly in this meeting
over all opposition and disorderly spirits. The 26th we
rested. The 27th we attended West Nottingham meeting to
good satisfaction, and were made to rejoice in truth’s victory over
death and darkness, for which the honest-hearted were made
thankful. The 28th we attended a meeting, lately established,
about five miles distant from the former, which I sat mostly in
silence, feeling no clear commission for preaching the gospel
among them.</p>

<p>The 1st of 3d month, we attended Little Britain meeting,
wherein I was opened and led into a large doctrinal communication,
suited to the states of many present. The meeting was
large and solid, and, I trust, edifying and instructive to a number
present. But too many, who have ears to hear, and are led to
acknowledge the truth of testimonies delivered, neglect the practical
part, which is the most essential; and are, therefore, in a
situation like those, who, seeing their natural faces in a glass,
turn away, and forget what manner of persons they are. The
2d, we passed over the river Susquehannah, and lodged at Richard
Webb’s, at Fawn, and attended their meeting next day. It
was a solid, and, I believe to many, a profitable season. The
4th, and first of the week, we attended Deer Creek meeting,
which was large, and favoured with the overshadowing wing
of heavenly regard. The condescending goodness and mercy
of a gracious God to his sinful creatures were marvellously displayed.
The meeting was composed, in part, of a number of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[Pg 66]</span>
dark undisciplined spirits, many of whom, it was thought, had
not been at any meeting for several years, and some of them
never at any of ours before. The meeting appeared to be generally
brought under a becoming solemnity, and concluded to our
solid comfort. The 5th, we attended Bush River meeting, and
although it was composed generally of a loose careless-minded
people, yet truth favoured me; and, through divine help, the
gospel was preached in the demonstration of the spirit, and with
power. Many present were made sensible of its baptizing influence;
and all contrary spirits appeared subjected, and brought
down, and truth reigned triumphant.</p>

<p>The 6th and 7th of 3d month, we attended the meetings at
Little Falls, and Gunpowder, both seasons of favour. The 8th
we attended Friends’ monthly meeting at Baltimore. It was, I
trust, a profitable season, both in the meeting for worship, and
that for the discipline of the Church. In the meeting for worship,
I was led, in a close searching testimony, to set forth the great
danger, and hurtful effects, of Friends joining in with the spirit
of the world, and taking any part in the fluctuating governments,
customs, and manners thereof. Things opened clearly
to show, that, in days past, the apostacy took place through that
medium, both among the primitive Christians, and also in our
own society; and that the only way, for us as a people to regain
the primitive state, was to return back into ancient simplicity, to
separate from the world, its spirit, governments, manners, and
maxims; and to make no league with those actuated thereby.
Truth rose into dominion, and the faithful among them were
strengthened. May praises for ever be ascribed to the Shepherd
of Israel, who is indeed a God near at hand, and a present helper
in every needful time.</p>

<p>The 9th we rested, and I wrote to my family and friends
at home. The 10th, we visited several families in the morning,
and in the afternoon, at the third hour, attended a meeting
among the poor, at the alms-house belonging to this city. It
proved a comfortable season, and I was glad I gave up to the
service. The 11th being the first of the week, we attended
Friends’ meeting in the forenoon, and some notice being given<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[Pg 67]</span>
among the town’s people of our being there, it was large; and
after sitting a considerable time in silent labour, wherein my
mind was baptized into the states of those present, I stood up
with a prospect of the hurtful tendency of pride, both in religious
and civil society. Truth opened the way, and gradually rose
into a good degree of dominion, and, I trust, it was a profitable
season to many present. In the afternoon, at the third hour, we
had a meeting with the black people; and, except the hurt
received by their long and untimely gathering, I think it was, in
general, a comfortable season; and many among them appeared
to be brought into a becoming solemnity, and we parted under
the savour of truth.</p>

<p>On the 12th, we attended a meeting at Elk Ridge; it proved,
in general, a heavy season, yet, I trust, a time of profit and
favour to some. We rode that afternoon thirteen miles towards
Indian Spring meeting, which we attended the next day. In
this meeting, I was led, in a plain and full manner, to expose the
enormous sin of oppression, and of holding our fellow creatures
in bondage, with the pernicious fruits and effects of it, to those
who are guilty thereof, especially to their children; who, being
supported by the labour and toil of those held in slavery, and
thereby brought up in idleness, were led into pride, and a very
false, and dark idea respecting God, and his superintending providence,
and into many other evils, fatal to their present and
eternal well being, and tending to disqualify them from being
useful in almost any respect, either to themselves or society, and
thereby rendering them unworthy of the respect of wise and good
men. Truth rose into dominion, and some present, who were
slave holders, were made sensible of their conditions, and were
much affected. I felt a hope to arise that the opportunity would
prove profitable to some, and I left them with peace of mind.
Since then, I have been informed, that a woman, present at that
season, who possessed a number of slaves, was so fully convinced,
as to set them free, and, not long after, joined in membership
with Friends: which is indeed cause of gratitude and
thankfulness of heart, to the great and blessed Author of every
mercy vouchsafed to the children of men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>On the 14th we were at Sandy Spring meeting, to satisfaction.
The 15th, we attended Friends’ preparative meeting at Alexandria.
It was a small weak meeting, very few manifesting any
real concern for the support of our Christian testimonies. They
gathered there from different parts of the country, mostly for the
advancement of their temporal interest; and this being uppermost
with them, they were disqualified for improvement in religious
experience. O that we, as a people, were more weaned
from the world and its fading enjoyments, and our affections
placed on celestial treasure; then would the light of the Church
break forth out of obscurity, and her darkness become as the
noonday; thousands would then be gathered from the highways
and hedges, and flock to the brightness of her arising, with everlasting
joy upon their heads.</p>

<p>The 16th we rode to Fairfax, about forty-six miles. The 17th
we attended their select quarterly meeting. The 18th, the first
of the week, we attended the meeting at this place, which was
large, composed of Friends and others. I was led to open the
great advantages attendant on a life of righteousness, from that
scripture passage, “Righteousness exalteth a nation; but sin is
a reproach to any people;” and showing the difference between
a righteousness, founded on the laws, maxims, and precepts of
men, and the righteousness that is witnessed by faith in the Son
of God, as revealed to the hearts and souls of the children of
men through the holy spirit. Although there were many raw,
and uncultivated persons present, yet truth came into a good
degree of dominion and victory, and, I trust, it was a profitable
season to some.</p>

<p>The 19th we attended the quarterly meeting for discipline, in
which I had some service, in opening the nature and end of
discipline, and encouraging Friends to an improvement therein,
to the solid satisfaction of the honest in heart. The next day
was the youth’s meeting for the last time; the quarterly meeting, the
day before, having concluded to discontinue the same thereafter,
from a belief that its usefulness was over; and that it had become
more hurtful than beneficial. A great concourse of idle
people came together at that time, not so much for the sake of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[Pg 69]</span>
the meeting, as to see and be seen, and to make it a place of
diversion. I had considerable to say among them, but got but
little relief; by reason, as I apprehended, of a spirit of infidelity
and licentiousness, too generally prevailing among the people. I
was satisfied the quarterly meeting had done right in discontinuing
that meeting; believing, if continued, it would have been
very prejudicial to the youth, for whose good, in the first institution
thereof, it was intended.</p>

<p>The 21st we attended the preparative meeting of South Fork,
which is a branch of Goose Creek monthly meeting. I was
silent in the meeting for worship, but had some close labour
with Friends in their preparative meeting. I felt my spirit much
oppressed with a sense of the great lukewarmness, and love of
the world, which appeared to prevail in such a manner, that the
business of the preparative meeting was conducted in a very
weak vague manner, and void of a right sense of the dignity of
such a meeting, or a due concern for the preservation of right
order. I felt peace of mind in a faithful discharge of my duty
among them.</p>

<p>The 22d we were at Goose Creek preparative meeting, which
was large in the first sitting, many of other societies coming in.
After a considerable time of silent labour, in deep baptism with
the suffering seed, my mouth was opened in a clear full testimony,
directed to the states of those present. And many were
brought under the influence of that power which “cut Rahab,
and wounded the dragon.” Truth came into dominion, and a
good degree of victory over all was witnessed. Nevertheless,
such is the deadness and indifference of some who go under our
name, that, at the close of this very solemn meeting for worship,
they withdrew with those who were not members, and continued
out until the preparative meeting had proceeded considerably in
its business; and then came in one after another, in a very careless
unthinking manner. My heart was grieved, and I have
often been affected with similar conduct in many places in those
parts, as also in some others; a conduct, which appears to me to
carry in it great indignity to our high and holy profession; and,
I believe, is greatly offensive to the great Head of the Church,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[Pg 70]</span>
for the promotion of whose righteous cause, these meetings for
discipline are established. I believe one great cause of this
sorrowful weakness and declension is owing to a want of due
administration of discipline, by those who are called thereto. By
overlooking one little thing after another, custom establishes those
bad habits; and great loss is sustained by the Church in general,
and by some of its members in particular. It is very observable
that meetings, where those things are apparent, are generally in
a declining state. I was exercised in a plain way of dealing
with those delinquents, showing them the hurtful tendency of
such conduct. Truth prevailed, and many hearts were much
tendered, and the hands of the faithful strengthened; to the Lord
only wise be the praise of his own work, who is over all, worthy
for ever.</p>

<p>The 23d we attended a meeting at a place called the Gap,
where there was a small meeting of Friends. It was, however,
a large collection, many of other societies attending, more than
the house could hold. Many of them appeared to be a raw
insensible people, void of any right idea or knowledge of true
religion, which made the meeting very trying and painful; yet
not without some degree of favour towards the conclusion, by
truth’s obtaining the victory over death and darkness.</p>

<p>Whilst in this neighbourhood, my mind was brought into a
state of deep exercise and travail, from a sense of the great turning
away of many among us, from the law and the testimony,
and the prevailing of a spirit of great infidelity and deism among
the people, and darkness spreading over the minds of many as a
thick veil. It was a time in which Thomas Paine’s <i>Age of
Reason</i> (falsely so called) was much attended to in those parts;
and some, who were members in our society, as I was informed,
were captivated by his dark insinuating address, and were ready
almost to make shipwreck of faith and a good conscience. Under
a sense thereof, my spirit was deeply humbled before the majesty
of heaven, and in the anguish of my soul, I said, “spare
thy people, O Lord, and give not thy heritage to reproach,” and
suffer not thy truth to fall in the streets.</p>

<p>The 24th we attended the monthly meeting at Fairfax, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[Pg 71]</span>
was an exercising season, things being much out of order, for
want of more faithfulness among the members, and a due attention
to discipline. I laboured among them in the ability received,
for their encouragement, and incitement to their respective duties;
but alas for us, most men mind their own things, and not
the things that are Jesus Christ’s. A worldly spirit too much
prevails among the professors of truth, to their great hurt, and to
the great grief of the honest-hearted, who are in travail for Zion’s
prosperity, and Jerusalem’s peace.</p>

<p>The 25th, we attended their first day meeting, which was
large, and in it strength was graciously afforded to minister to
the people in truth’s authority, which came into dominion over
all. This afternoon we passed over the great river Potomac, in
our way to Bush Creek, in Maryland; this, by reason of rains,
was very full, and difficult to pass. After we had passed over the
river Potomac, we had much difficulty in crossing a creek not far
from it. There was a floating bridge over it; but the water was
so high, that we could not approach the bridge by the road commonly
used; and we only succeeded in reaching it, by proceeding
ourselves on the top of a high fence, and leading our horses by
our sides. Mine fell into a deep part of the creek; but he soon
rose, and swam to the shore. A Friend was in company with
us, with a one horse carriage; and there appeared to be no way
of getting his conveyance over, but by the horse swimming with
it over the creek. This we knew would be attended with considerable
risk, as the creek was deep in the middle, and the carriage
a heavy one. But as there were no inhabitants on this
neck of land, nor near to it, and as night was coming on, we
pursued that course, and led the horse with the carriage into the
creek; and after violent exertions, being at one time drawn
under water by the weight of the carriage, he took it safe over.
We were thus favoured to surmount this great difficulty, without
any hurt to ourselves, or our horses; which was cause of thankfulness
and gratitude to the great Author of every mercy and
blessing.</p>

<p>We proceeded to a Friend’s house by the name of Richard
Richardson, where we had a meeting the next day, with his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[Pg 72]</span>
family, and a number of the neighbouring people, who were not
Friends. It proved a favoured season, and I trust will not soon
be forgotten by some present; may it fasten as a nail in a sure
place; and to some I have a hope it may be as bread cast upon
the waters, to return after many days.</p>

<p>The day following we attended Bush Creek meeting, notice
having gone forward some days before, of our intention of being
there at this time; it was large, and greatly favoured with
the prevalence of truth, by way of testimony. Many things,
relative to true gospel worship, were clearly opened, and the
fallacy and fruitlessness of all-will worship, and mere bodily exercise,
in matters of religion, manifested to the view of all present,
who had eyes to see, and hearts to understand, what the spirit
saith to the Churches. It was a very solemn time, worthy of
grateful remembrance.</p>

<p>The 28th we attended Pipe Creek meeting, wherein I was
greatly afflicted with evil thoughts, which would keep arising in
my mind, that I was almost at times taken off from my proper
exercise. This very much grieved my spirit; but, as I endeavoured
to keep up the warfare, I was led to believe it was the
case with too many present; and that by giving way to such
thoughts, some had become captivated by their own lusts, wounding
one another; and divers disorders, and a want of unity, had
got in among them, and many hurt thereby. I was led into the
necessity of bearing testimony against these things, as way opened,
and calling the attention of all present, to the light, spirit,
grace, and truth of our Lord Jesus Christ, our holy pattern, as
the only place of refuge and preservation from these, and all
other hurtful things. After this meeting, the Friend, where we
lodged, informed me the next morning, that himself and his
wife were uneasy that no Friends had come in to see us after
the meeting, and were afraid they would judge them of having
informed me of their condition, the states of many had been so
exactly described in the meeting; but I told him they need not
be troubled, as they knew themselves to be clear.</p>

<p>The two following days we attended meetings at <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Monallen">Menallen</span>
and Huntington; they were both exercising seasons; neverthe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[Pg 73]</span>less,
truth favoured me with ability and understanding to communicate
in a close searching manner, suited to the states of
those present; and a crumb of consolation was handed forth to
the few honest-hearted, who were in travail for Zion’s arising,
and who went mourning on their way, and bowed in spirit, from
a sense of the great turning away from the law and testimony,
and the prevalence of a spirit of ease and great indifference,
whereby many wrong things had entered.</p>

<p>From thence we passed on to Warrington and Newberry, in
each of which meetings truth favoured with victory; and the
hidden things of Esau, or the first nature, which are earthly,
were brought to light, searched out, detected, and condemned.
The manner and way in which the new or second birth, which is
spiritual, and which has the promise, is brought forth and effected,
was clearly shown and pointed out; with the blessing attendant
thereon, to the comfort of the faithful, and the few willing minded
among them, and to the stirring up and arousing the lukewarm,
careless, and indifferent professors, from their beds of ease and
carnal security. The latter meeting especially was a time to be
remembered; many hearts were greatly affected, and, I trust,
the season will not soon be forgotten by some. I was very
thankful for the relief I felt to my own mind, after many days
of deep baptism with the suffering seed. Religion appeared to be
at a very low ebb in those parts, by the prevalence of a worldly
spirit, which makes hard work for the poor travellers, who
have to go up and down among them, as with their hands upon
their loins for very pain. Did those lukewarm careless professors
rightly consider the great distress and exercise they bring
upon their concerned brethren, who are in travail for their redemption
and salvation; and who are going up and down as
with their lives in their hands, through difficulties and dangers,
in jeopardy by sea and by land, and among false brethren, we
might reasonably suppose it would be a means to stir them up
to more diligence and circumspection, that they might thereby
comfort them in their exercises, and relieve them in their tribulations;
then they that sow, and they that reap, might rejoice
together, and joy in the God of their salvation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>Our next meeting was at Yorktown, where we tarried two
days, and were at their monthly meeting, wherein things appeared
distressingly low, as to the right conducting of discipline in truth’s
authority: indeed the meeting seemed sunk so below any proper
sight and sense of right order, that no way opened to administer
much or any help; and we left them without obtaining much
relief of mind. We passed on, having a meeting near Wright’s
ferry; and then crossed the great river Susquehannah, and had
meetings at Lancaster and Lampeter. On first day, the 8th of
4th month, we attended a meeting at Sadsbury, which, through
hard labour, proved a season of enlargement, in a line of close
doctrine, suited to the varied states of those present; some minds
appeared to be much humbled; may it not be in vain, but as
seed sown on good ground.</p>

<p>The 10th of 4th month we attended West Caln meeting, the
11th Fallowfield, both favoured meetings. The 12th we attended
London Grove meeting, wherein I was led to open the duty
and obligation incumbent on ministers, elders, overseers, and
heads of families. I began with this query of the prophet Isaiah,
“Watchman, what of the night;” showing that for want of
keeping up a strict watch, with an eye single to that inward
holy monitor, or spirit of pure unerring wisdom, many hurtful
and destructive things had got in among us. Especially for
want of a godly care in parents and heads of families, over their
children and those under their charge, many pollutions had got
in, and spread among them; particularly the youth, not only in
regard to a departure from the simplicity and purity of our holy, self-denying
profession, in dress and address, but also in many other
unseemly and reproachful practices; which is but the natural
consequence of parents indulging undue liberties in their children.
It was a solemn time, worthy of grateful remembrance. The
13th we were at West Grove meeting, in which I had to go
through a similar exercise; from a sense of the great want of
faithfulness among the members, whereby many deficiencies
were apparent, wounding the faithful. Truth favoured me with
ability to clear myself among them, with plainness of speech;
which was cause of thankfulness to the honest-hearted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>The 14th we attended New Garden meeting, mostly in silence,
in which I had peace. The 15th, and first of the week, we
attended Hockesson meeting; and, at the fourth hour in the
afternoon were at Center; the 16th at Kennet; these were, for
the most part, suffering seasons. Although there is a small
remnant preserved, who are in travail for truth’s arising, yet the
greater part are too much captivated by a worldly spirit; which
leads into a neglect of attending meetings, and great carelessness
in respect to the right ordering their families; by reason whereof,
many undue liberties have got in among them, wounding the
faithful and honest-hearted.</p>

<p>The 17th we attended Chichester meeting; it was a time
thankfully to be remembered; the everlasting gospel of peace
and salvation was preached in truth’s authority; and all contrary
spirits were subjected and brought down. Truth reigned
triumphantly over all; magnified for ever be the name of
the Lord, who made bare his arm for our help, and the
strengthening and refreshing of my poor soul. I had been at
times, for days and nights past, ready to sink into discouragement
and dismay, by reason of the deep baptisms I had to pass through,
unknown to man, but in fellowship with the suffering seed,
which lies smothered and pressed down in the hearts of many
careless and lukewarm professors, as a cart under sheaves. Oh
how does darkness and death spread itself, as a curtain, in this
once highly favoured land! Alas for the people, for the professors
of truth; what will become of them, unless they repent and turn
to the Lord. Parents and children, in some places, are so
estranged from the law and testimony, that many seem plunged
into the condition of Jerusalem formerly, when this pathetic
lamentation was taken up by the dear Master; “O Jerusalem,
Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which
are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children
even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye
would not. Behold your house is left unto you desolate.” Oh
how is this verified; what great desolations, in a religious
sense, are apparent with many professors; and how are the
poor servants, that are sent forth among them for their reco<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[Pg 76]</span>very,
as with their lives in their hands, as it were stoned, and
often so plunged into death and sufferings, as almost to despair
of life! Oh the pangs that my poor soul has endured of late, in
many places; so that I had often to say in secret, with the holy
apostle; “why stand we in jeopardy every hour?” No tongue
can tell, nor is it in the power of language to communicate, the
distress and anguish, which is sometimes endured by the poor
travellers, in filling up their measure of the afflictions of Christ,
for his body’s sake, the Church. But, in this also, we are sometimes
strengthened to rejoice, that we are accounted worthy to
suffer with Him, that when he is pleased to arise in his own
strength, as the light of the morning, we may be permitted to reign
with Him; and rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory.</p>

<p>The three following days, we were at Concord, Birmingham,
and Bradford, all favoured meetings, through fervent labour, and
the prevalence of truth; may the Lord make it effectual, and
fasten it as a nail in a sure place. The 21st we were at East
Caln, mostly silent. The 22d, and first of the week, we were
at Uwchlan; the meeting was large, wherein I had to expose
the danger of self-righteousness, or a trust in natural religion, or
mere morality; showing that it was no more than the religion
of Atheists, and was generally the product of pride and self-will;
and, however good it may appear to the natural unregenerate
man, is as offensive in the divine sight, as those more open evils,
which appear so very reproachful to the eyes of men. I was
favoured by the spirit of truth, in a large searching testimony, to
the convicting and humbling many hearts, and comfort of the
faithful.</p>

<p>The 23d we attended the meeting at Nantmill, mostly in
silence. The three following days, we were at Pikeland, Valley,
and Willistown meetings; all in a good degree favoured. The
27th we were at Goshen; the meeting was large. I had to
caution Friends against mixing with the people in their human
policies, and outward forms of government; showing that, in all
ages, those, who were called to be the Lord’s people, had been
ruined, or suffered great loss, by such associations; and manifesting
clearly by scripture testimony, and other records, that our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[Pg 77]</span>
strength and preservation consisted in standing alone, and not to
be counted among the people or nations; who were setting up
party, and partial interests, one against another, which is the
ground of war and bloodshed: these are actuated by the spirit of
pride, and wrath, which is always opposed to the true Christian
spirit, which breathes “peace on earth, and goodwill to all men.”
Those, therefore, who are in the true Christian spirit, cannot use
any coercive force or compulsion by any means whatever; not
being overcome with evil, but overcoming evil with good. Although
there were many opposing spirits present, who, in their
creaturely wisdom and human policy, are pleading for those
kinds of associations, and taking part in those political governments,
yet truth favoured, and came into a good degree of
dominion over all, strengthening and encouraging the true
travellers for Zion’s prosperity.</p>

<p>The 29th, and first of the week, we attended Middletown
meeting; and at the fourth hour in the afternoon, were at Providence;
both large crowded meetings, more than the houses could
contain. I was favoured by the power of truth, in an eminent
manner, especially in the former meeting; where many hearts
were deeply bowed, from the sensible evidence of the prevalence
of divine power, which was in dominion over all, tendering the
hearts of most present. It was a precious season, worthy of
thankful remembrance, and humble gratitude to the blessed
Author of all our rich mercies and blessings, “who is over all,
God blessed for ever.”</p>

<p>The 30th we attended the monthly meeting at Providence,
consisting of the particular meetings of Providence, Middletown,
Springfield, and Chester. Things in this meeting appeared in
a low state, as to the right ordering of the affairs of the Church.
Numerous, and great, were the apparent deviations among them;
many of their youth were gone out into the foolish fashions and
vain customs of the world to such a degree, as not to retain any
marks of true primitive plainness. “O how is the gold become
dim; how is the most fine gold changed!” Many parents, who
retain a good degree of outward plainness themselves, for want
of dwelling enough in the pure spring of divine life, have suf<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[Pg 78]</span>fered
the eye of their minds to be so far blinded by the god of this
world, as not only to suffer these improper indulgences in their
families, and among their children, but, in some instances, are
ready to plead for them. The sense of this much affected my
mind, and under this exercise I was led forth in a line of close
searching labour among them, to stir up Friends to more diligence,
and honest care in those respects; which, I trust, afforded a
degree of comfort and strength to the honest-hearted, and procured
peace to my own mind, which is a treasure I prefer to all
this world’s glory and honour.</p>

<p>The 1st of 5th month we attended the meetings of Springfield,
and Haverford; both favoured, profitable seasons. The 2d we
were at Newtown, where, in a line of close searching labour, I
was led to show the danger of trusting the salvation of our souls
to any thing short of a full surrender of our wills, and an entire
dedication of our hearts to the Lord, in an humble circumspect
walking before Him; and separating ourselves from the world,
its spirit, manners, maxims, governments, honours and customs;
all of which are polluted, and arising from the lusts of the flesh,
the lusts of the eye and the pride of life. Truth rose into victory,
softening many hearts, and comforting and strengthening
the faithful. Surely God is good to Israel, although in a state
of great revolting; yet he delighteth in showing himself merciful;
praised and magnified be his great and adorable name, over
all for ever.</p>

<p>The 3d and 4th we attended meetings at Radnor and Merion;
and then passed on to Philadelphia, to attend their quarterly meeting,
which opened on the 5th, with a meeting for Ministers and
Elders, and closed on third day the 8th of the month, with a
meeting for the youth, and one for the black people, in the afternoon.
I think, in general, it was a time of favour, through
much hard labour in the several sittings. Indeed we have no
reason to expect to come at the spring any other way, than by
faithfully digging, as with our staves, while there remains so much
rubbish on the well’s mouth.</p>

<p>The 9th we attended the select quarterly meeting at Abington;
and the day following the quarterly meeting for discipline. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[Pg 79]</span>
was engaged among them, in each meeting, and the favour
extended was cause of thankfulness to the honest-hearted. The
11th we returned to Philadelphia; and, in the afternoon, passed
over the river Delaware to Haddonfield in West Jersey. The
12th we attended a monthly meeting at Upper Evesham; it was
a low time, with not much of that divine life and power, which
only can qualify for the right conducting of discipline, to be felt
among them; and left them without much relief of mind.</p>

<p>The 13th of the month, and first of the week, we attended
meetings at Evesham, and Cropwell; in the former, I was
helped to labour pretty largely in testimony, to the comfort of a
few honest-hearted, and a number of youth with tender minds;
but the greater part of the meeting appeared to be in a state of
great insensibility and ease; a situation which is generally callous
to all the tender invitations, and entreaty of their friends,
who are in travail for their redemption and salvation; and too
much like the deaf adder, which will not listen to the voice of the
charmer, although he charm ever so wisely. In the latter meeting,
I was silent as to ministry.</p>

<p>The 14th we attended the monthly meeting at Haddonfield,
in which I laboured, in the ability received, for their help and
improvement. But alas, some meetings are so lost to the life of
true religion, and so many, who go under our profession, are
sunk into such a state of indifference and lukewarmness, that
the affairs of the Church are too much conducted in a kind of
rotation, and creaturely wisdom, void of that true weight, and
feeling sensibility, which only gives right qualification for service
in the Church; hence great weakness ensues, and the way of
right reformation is closed, and truth prevented from arising in
its primitive splendour and beauty.</p>

<p>The 15th we were at Moore’s Town and <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Rancocus">Rancocas</span>; in the
former meeting, the power that “cut Rahab, and wounded the
dragon,” manifestly prevailed to the tendering many hearts.
Truth came into victory over all; praised for ever be the right
worthy name of Israel’s King, who, in holy condescending love,
was pleased to make bare his arm for our help; and once more
redeemed my poor soul out of adversity, and the deep depressing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[Pg 80]</span>
baptisms, which for some days past it had been plunged into, by
suffering with the seed, which lies pressed down in the hearts
of many lukewarm worldly minded professors, as a cart with
sheaves. From thence we passed on, having meetings at Mansfield
Neck, Burlington, Mansfield, and Bordentown; which
were all favoured meetings, truth being near for our help.</p>

<p>The 20th, and first of the week, we were at Trenton; the
meeting was large, many of the town’s people, of other professions,
came in. Strength was made manifest in the midst of
weakness, and, as truth arose, the gospel was preached in the
clear demonstration of the spirit; many hearts were tendered
and comforted, and the few faithful made to rejoice, in a grateful
sense of the Lord’s mercies.</p>

<p>The 22d we were at Stony Brook meeting, wherein my heart
was made glad through holy help, and I was enabled to labour
among them in truth’s authority, to the comfort of the willing-hearted,
and the solid peace of my own mind. The two following
days we were at Plainfield, and Rahway; in the latter
meeting I was wholly silent; but the former was a time of close
labour, in a clear plain way, to stir up the minds of the people to
more diligence, and an inward humble walking with the Lord;
which appeared to be too much wanting among them.</p>

<p>The 25th we attended an appointed meeting at Newark, a
town wherein no Friends reside. The meeting was small, and
those gathered appeared mostly in a loose uncultivated state of
mind; yet, I believe, there were some thoughtful persons present;
and, I trust, the meeting was in some degree profitable. I left
them with peace of mind, and proceeded that evening to New-York
to attend the yearly meeting, which was to be opened
there on the next day, with a meeting for Ministers and Elders.
After the first sitting of the meeting, I rode home, not only to
see my dear wife and family, from whom I had been absent
more than five months, but also to assist them in getting out to
the yearly meeting. Our rejoicing was precious, and mutual, in
and under a sense of the Lord’s mercy and goodness, for whose
gracious preservation and help, in this arduous journey, my spirit
was made to bow in humble adoration and praise, beyond the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[Pg 81]</span>
expression of language. Oh my soul, what canst thou render
unto the Lord for all his benefits! Nothing can be more acceptable,
than an entire surrender of thine all to his holy disposing;
and to endeavour, as at the present time, to continue humbly to
worship at the footstool of his holy throne of grace. Amen.</p>

<p>I was absent from home in this journey about five months and
two weeks, and rode about sixteen hundred miles, and attended
about one hundred and forty-three meetings.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</h2>



<p class="chap-head">Visit to Connecticut, 1799.&mdash;Visit to Oblong and Nine Partners, 1800.&mdash;Visit
on Long Island, 1800.&mdash;Visit to Friends in New-Jersey, and Pennsylvania,
1801.</p>


<p>Having felt a concern, for some time, to pay a religious visit
to some towns and places in Connecticut, and, in my way, to be
with the few Friends at West Hartford, I laid my prospect before
my friends in the fall of the year 1799, and received a minute
of concurrence and unity from our monthly meeting. I left
home the 26th of 10th month, and proceeded to Oblong, in order
to meet a committee of our yearly meeting, appointed this year,
to visit the quarterly meetings of Nine Partners and Oblong, and
the monthly meetings belonging thereto; a proposition having
been made for a new arrangement of those meetings, so as to
establish another quarterly meeting. I accompanied the committee
in the attendance of both quarterly meetings.</p>

<p>After this, we proceeded into Connecticut, attending meetings
in our way to West Hartford, in the following manner, viz:
three in the town of Sharon, one at Cornwall, one at Goshen,
and one at Litchfield. They were all favoured meetings. Four
of them were held in meeting-houses belonging to the Presbyterians.
The latter meeting was but small, considering the largeness
of the town, and the great openness manifested by their
leading members; there were three of their ministers, and some
other leading men present. Truth was prevalently manifest
in this meeting, tendering and comforting the honest-hearted, a
number of whom, I believe, were at the meeting, whose words
and conduct clearly manifested a hearty thankfulness for, and
satisfaction with, the opportunity. Although the great opposition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[Pg 83]</span>
those meet with, in coming out of their old traditions, may prevent
any open and manifest effects for the present, yet, I believe,
it will be as bread cast upon the waters, which will return after
many days; so that his word which goeth forth, may not return
void, but will accomplish the purpose for which it was sent, to
the praise and glory of his own worthy name, “who is over all,
God blessed for ever.”</p>

<p>After this meeting, we passed directly to West Hartford, and
lodged with our friend Ebenezer Crosby, whose daughter Abigail
had come in company with us from Nine Partners. She
was a discreet religious young woman, whose mind, I apprehended,
was under the operation of the forming hand, for her
good; may she be preserved in faith and patience, under the
varied turnings thereof upon her; and then, I have no doubt, she
will become a useful member in the Church.</p>

<p>The next day we rode to Springfield, about twenty-six miles
north of this place; and attended a meeting there the following
day. Although the people appeared generally raw and ignorant,
as to the internal work of true religion on the heart, being mostly
of those persuasions, whose doctrines lead them to place too much
trust and dependence on the external works of a <i>Saviour without
them</i>, and an <i>imputative righteousness</i>; and not experiencing
the <i>internal work of sanctification</i>, wrought by the
spirit and power of a <i>Saviour within them</i>; which is a very
dangerous errour; nevertheless, I was favoured by the Lord’s
power to relieve my mind, and divers appeared to be tenderly
affected, and manifested much satisfaction with the opportunity,
as did the auditory in general.</p>

<p>We rode back that afternoon to West Hartford, and the day
following, the first of the week, and 17th of 11th month, we
attended Friends’ meeting; and another at the house of our
friend Ebenezer Crosby, in the evening. They were full meetings,
many of other societies attending, mostly Presbyterians.
Truth favoured, in an eminent degree, in both opportunities, but
especially in the latter, wherein it rose into great dominion, breaking
down, and apparently reducing every contrary spirit. A remarkable
calm, and general solemnity was felt to spread over the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[Pg 84]</span>
assembly, to the solid rejoicing and comfort of many hearts, and
the exaltation of the cause and testimony of our God; who, for
this, and his multiplied favours and blessings, vouchsafed from
time to time, is worthy of all honour, dominion and glory, both
now and for ever.</p>

<p>The next day, feeling my mind drawn to some of the adjacent
towns, we rode about ten miles, to a place called Perquanock,
a thickly settled village in the west part of the township of West
Windsor. We had a precious opportunity there that evening,
in a large school-house. Although the notice was very short, it
being late in the afternoon when we came there, yet, when we
reached the meeting, which began at the sixth hour, the house
was nearly full, and soon after taking our seats was crowded
with as many as it could well contain. A commendable stillness
was maintained during the silent part of the meeting, which we
thought a little uncommon, as the people were generally strangers
to us, and our ways. After a time of solemn waiting, my
mouth was opened in a clear full testimony; wherein the doctrines
of the gospel were largely and plainly held forth, in the
demonstration of the spirit, and with power, tendering many
hearts, and to the apparent satisfaction of the people in general;
many expressing their thankfulness for the favour. We left
them with the answer of peace in our own minds, and in a full
persuasion, that the Lord is secretly at work in the minds of
many of the people in these parts, in order to deliver them from
the power of their dark and blind leaders, who, for a long time,
by their carnal and lifeless teachings and doctrines, and many
<i>vain traditions</i>, have formed almost a total eclipse between God
and their souls. May the Lord hasten this good work in his own
time, that those merchants of Babylon, who are trafficking in the
souls of the people, those blind guides may be so discovered, that
no man may buy their merchandize any more.</p>

<p>The day after, we attended a meeting in Windsor town; the
people here seemed to be more under the dark power of their
teachers, being much blinded with the prejudice of education, so
that the meeting was but small. Nevertheless, truth favoured
me with ability to preach the gospel, with a good degree of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[Pg 85]</span>
divine authority, to the comfort and edification of some seeking
minds present. The two following days we attended Friends’
meeting at Hartford, the latter of which was appointed by our
friend Jervis Johnson, from Ireland. Both were comfortable
seasons.</p>

<p>The sixth of the week, and 22d of the month, we rode to the
city of Hartford; and way opening for an opportunity with the
people, a meeting was accordingly appointed at the sixth hour
in the evening, to be held in a large meeting-house belonging to
the Presbyterians. A great number of the citizens assembled,
supposed to be near a thousand, among whom were most of the
principal inhabitants. The Lord, in whom was our trust, was
graciously near, and furnished us with ability to conduct the
meeting to the satisfaction and peace of our own minds; and to
the edification of many present, and general satisfaction of the
assembly.</p>

<p>We rested on seventh day, and, on first day, we were again
at Friends’ meeting at West Hartford; and notice that we were
to be there having spread, a considerable number of the neighbouring
inhabitants and some from the city came in. It was a
season of high favour; many weighty truths of the gospel were
clearly opened, and the way of life and salvation placed before
the minds of the people; and a general solemnity appeared to
reign, which was manifest in almost every countenance, silencing
every opposite spirit. The hearts of Friends, with my own spirit,
were bowed in humble acknowledgment and gratitude to the
Lord our helper, for granting us so great a mercy; and under a
solemn sense thereof we parted, and took leave of each other in
great nearness of spirit.</p>

<p>On second day we turned our faces homeward, attending
meetings in our way at Cambridge and Woodbury; at the latter
place we had two meetings; we also had meetings at Middlesex,
and Stamford, and again at Middlesex on first day; these were
generally seasons of divine favour, edifying and instructive.
After this we passed on into the state of New-York, and had
meetings the six following days, at Rye, White Plains, North
Castle, Shapaqua, Amawalk, and Croton. As my mind was led,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[Pg 86]</span>
in faith and patience, to close in with the baptismal influence of
the spirit of truth, it was reduced into a state of suffering with
the precious seed in the hearts of the people, and their divers
states were felt, and way made to divide the word aright to those
assembled; who were a mixed number of Friends and others.
Truth was exalted, and set over every contrary spirit, and the
honest-hearted comforted and encouraged to persevere in the
“work of righteousness,” which “shall be peace; and the effect
of righteousness, quietness and assurance for ever.”</p>

<p>The following first day we attended Friends’ meeting at West
Chester; and in the afternoon we had an appointed meeting
at East Chester, principally among those not of our society.
We had cause, in both these meetings, to magnify and adore
the name of the Lord, who deigned to be near with his saving
help, and furnished with ability to preach the gospel of life and
salvation, in the clear demonstration of the spirit; the power
attending, convicting and tendering many hearts. The few
Friends, who dwell in that place, were strengthened and encouraged,
and my spirit refreshed and made to rejoice, in those
closing opportunities. After this I returned home, and found my
dear wife and tender children all well, to our mutual rejoicing.
I was out about six weeks, and attended about thirty meetings,
and two quarterly meetings.</p>

<p>On my return from my late visit in Connecticut, I felt my
mind not fully clear of a prospect I then had of a few other
places; and the way opening with greater clearness, and feeling
a motion of love to draw towards again attending the ensuing
quarterly meetings of Oblong and Nine Partners, after attending
our quarterly meeting at Westbury, in 1st month, 1800, I set out
with Amos Whitson as my companion. We attended Purchase
meeting on first day, which I sat in silence, and passed from
thence to Oblong, and attended their quarterly meeting. After
this we had a meeting at Kent, in our way to Nine Partners.
The people of this place are mostly of the Presbyterian society,
and a considerable number assembled, and behaved in an orderly
manner. I trust the opportunity was a season of profit, and
that the labour bestowed may be, to some of those present, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[Pg 87]</span>
bread cast upon the waters. After attending the quarterly meeting
of Nine Partners, we had two meetings in our way to Cornwall
and Goshen, among those not of our society, though nothing
very remarkable occurred in either. We had a comfortable
meeting at Cornwall, and visited Charles Richards and some
others, who appeared to be going into a separation from Friends,
having already set up a separate meeting, for which they were
not long after disowned. They had given way to some very
inconsistent notions, in which they became so hardened as not
to take the tender counsel and advice of their friends, who
laboured much with them for their recovery. From thence we
returned home, having a few meetings in our way, mostly
among people of other persuasions. We got well home on first
day evening, the 16th of 2d month, after attending the morning
meeting at New-York. As I took this little journey in part to
fill up what seemed lacking in the other, I now felt clear, and
my mind was accompanied with true peace, which raised in me
humble acknowledgments and gratitude to the great and blessed
Author of all our mercies.</p>

<p>Soon after my return from the above little journey, I felt my
mind drawn, in the renewed feelings of gospel love, to pay a
religious visit to some of the inhabitants of our island, not of our
profession. After having opened my prospect to Friends and
obtained the unity and concurrence of our monthly meeting, I
performed that service, in the latter part of the fall, and beginning
of the winter following. I was out from home twenty-seven
days, rode about one hundred and ninety miles, and
attended thirty-five meetings; only two of which were held in
our meeting-houses. They were generally seasons of great favour,
in which my mind was deeply bowed, under a humiliating
sense of the Lord’s mercy, extended from day to day, not only
in opening the hearts of the people to receive us and our testimony
with manifestation of much love and good will; but also
in furnishing matter suitably adapted to the states of those assembled.
Truth was raised into victory, in a remarkable manner,
in almost every meeting; and in several, to a very eminent
degree, even beyond, as I thought, what I had ever before expe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[Pg 88]</span>rienced.
It ran over like oil. All appeared broken down by its
precious and embalming influence, in which the Lord was worshipped,
and his great and glorious name praised and exalted
over all, who is worthy for ever.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1801, feeling my mind engaged, in the love of
the gospel, to proceed in a visit to Friends, in some parts of Jersey
and Pennsylvania, and some places adjacent thereto, I left home
the 11th of 4th month, with the concurrence and unity of my
friends; and with Edmund Willis as a companion. We rode to
New-York, and attended Friends’ forenoon and afternoon meetings
there, on first day. Although the life of religion appeared at
a low ebb with Friends of that city, in too general a manner;
yet a number of the younger class, and some more advanced in
life, gave some hope of improvement. My mind was deeply engaged
among them. And, through the condescending goodness
of the Shepherd of Israel, strength was witnessed to preach the
gospel in the demonstration of the spirit, and with power; insomuch
that a fresh visitation was extended to many present.
May it rest, and be fastened by the Master of assemblies, as a
nail in a sure place, to the honour of his great and glorious
name, who is the blessed Author and finisher of every good word
and work.</p>

<p>On second day we left the city, and passed to Elizabethtown
Point, Woodbridge and upper Freehold. And on fourth day,
we attended a meeting in the neighbourhood, called Robbins’
meeting, at the usual time; and in the afternoon attended Upper
Freehold meeting. The former was usually a small, weak meeting;
but information of our intention to be there, being generally
spread, many came in who were not members; and it proved a
profitable edifying season, worthy of grateful remembrance. The
latter was rather a season of suffering with the seed. I was
mostly shut up as to any ministerial communication. The next
day we attended the meetings of Crosswicks, and Upper Springfield;
at both of which strength was afforded to communicate
what opened in the line of duty, in such a manner as to find
relief of mind, which I account a great favour.</p>

<p>We rode to Philadelphia on sixth day, and the next day the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[Pg 89]</span>
yearly meeting of Ministers and Elders opened; and on the
ensuing second day, the yearly meeting for discipline, which was
very large, and continued, by adjournments, through the week,
and closed on seventh day. Many weighty subjects were opened
for deliberation. But through the prevalence and mixture of
unsubjected spirits, who were too forward and active in their
own unmortified wills, much weakness was apparent. This
greatly increased the burden of the living, and truly baptized
members, of which class there were a very considerable number,
who were deeply engaged for the promotion of the cause of truth,
and that the family at large might be kept in decent and commendable
order, consistent with the gospel of Christ; and become
established on the ancient foundation of our holy profession.
These were nearly united in spirit and in travail for Zion’s arising,
and the Lord was graciously pleased to water them together,
at seasons, with the descendings of heavenly dew; by which,
encouragement was witnessed, to persevere in patience, and in
thankful acknowledgment, for his continued mercy; and they
were favoured to return from their annual solemnity with rejoicing,
for all the good the Lord had been pleased to favour them
with.</p>

<p>We remained in the city over first day, and attended the forenoon
meeting at Market-street, which was very large. My
spirit was set at liberty, and ability afforded to divide the word
among them, according to their varied conditions, in a large
searching and effectual testimony; whereby a holy solemnity
was witnessed to spread over the meeting, to the great rejoicing
of the honest-hearted. But alas, how oft are those seasons of
comfort interrupted and hurt, by the indiscreet forwardness of
some who have been called to publish the gospel; but, for want
of dwelling enough in the root, have branched out in the fertility
of their own natural abilities, and become too active in their own
spirits; and are thereby not only in danger of losing their gifts,
and falling into a bewildered state, but often hurt the service, and
take off the savour of many of our most favoured solemnities.
This was affectingly the case at this time, by the addition of a
long, but very lifeless testimony; and although delivered in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[Pg 90]</span>
sound words, yet being destitute of the life and power, tended
greatly to burden the living, and grieve the upright in heart.
Great advantage would redound to the Church in general, and
to this class of its members in particular, if those, who stand in
the station of Elders, were more deeply centered in their minds
to the well-spring of eternal life; waiting for, and feeling after a
spirit of right discernment, that so they might be enabled to judge
righteous judgment, and distinguish rightly between the living
and the dead. Then would the hand be seasonably laid upon
the head of this <i>transforming spirit</i>, and those, in danger of
being deceived thereby, witness preservation.</p>

<p>On second day, the 27th of 4th month, we left the city, and
passed over into West Jersey, in order to take some meetings
which I had not been at. We were at five in the course of the
week; and although the life and virtue of true religion appeared
to be at a low ebb, among those professing with us, in too general
a manner, in those meetings; yet as public notice was given
of our attendance, many of the neighbouring inhabitants came
in. There were, I believe, some seeking minds among them,
and these generally add life to meetings, and draw down the
compassion, and tender regard of the heavenly parent, who, in
his condescending goodness, made way for the gospel to be preached
among them, in those several meetings, in a good degree of
divine authority. Many minds were tenderly affected, and the
assemblies solemnized; the lukewarm aroused, and the hypocritical,
worldly-minded professors forewarned of the danger their
situations exposed them to. My spirit was made thankful for
the relief I obtained, although through a line of deep inward
travail and baptism with the oppressed seed; but the Lord’s
power rose in victory over all, to the honour of his right worthy
name, who will be glorified in his saints, and sanctified in all
those who come near him.</p>

<p>We returned to the city on seventh day, and attended the quarterly
meeting of Ministers and Elders; in which I was led, in a short,
but relieving testimony, to call Friends’ attention back to primitive
simplicity and integrity; the great need there is of being
more separated from the world, its spirit, manners, maxims, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[Pg 91]</span>
customs; and to live daily under an exercise and travail, for the
arising of that life and power, which only can enable us to separate
from those things, that have a tendency to hurt and defile;
and through which life and power, Ministers and Elders can
only be rightly qualified to lead and feed the flock, over which
the Holy Ghost hath made them overseers, consistent with divine
appointment. For want of this fervent labour and travail,
great weakness is apparent amongst us as a people, in many
places; and the great and worthy name by which we are called,
ofttimes dishonoured, to the grief of the upright in heart, who are
exercised for Israel’s prosperity, and Jerusalem’s peace; and who
go almost daily, as with their hands on their loins for very pain.</p>

<p>On first day, we attended the north meeting, in the morning,
and that in Market-street in the afternoon. They were both
instructive edifying seasons; wherein I had full opportunity to relieve
my mind, being, through gracious assistance, led in the clear
openings of the divine light, to set forth the great danger of
mixing in with the spirit of the world, which leads to strife and
contention, and the promotion of parties and party animosities in
civil governments: all of which have a direct tendency to engender
war and bloodshed, and are therefore inconsistent for us, as
a people, to touch or take part with, or to suffer our minds to be
agitated thereby; as it always has led, and always will lead those,
who are leavened therewith, out of the meek spirit of the gospel,
which breathes “peace on earth, and good will to all men.” This
was the Lord’s doing and marvellous in our eyes. Friends
were much comforted and united in this day’s exercise, and my
spirit made joyful in the saving help, and continued mercy of
Israel’s true Shepherd, who is over all, worthy, and blessed for ever.</p>

<p>The quarterly meeting was held on second day, which was
likewise a time of favour. Divers communications were made,
tending to unite Friends in an exercise for the advancement of
the testimony, that the numerous causes of weakness, which
brought pain, and many deep baptisms on the living part of the
body, might be done away, and the camp cleansed.</p>

<p>I left the city on third day morning, with a peaceful mind,
and rode to Frankford; and attended a meeting there in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[Pg 92]</span>
forenoon, and one at Germantown in the afternoon, in both of
which I laboured in the ability received. The first was a very
searching season; things were laid open in such a manner, that
the dead, in some instances, seemed to be raised, and that power
felt, which opened the graves formerly; and some of those,
who were settled down in their polluted rests, had their heavens
shaken, and their rocks made to melt, by the fervent heat of
the <i>divine word</i>, which was as a fire and a hammer. Truth
prevailed, and was eminently in dominion over all.</p>

<p>On fourth and fifth days, we attended the quarterly meeting of
Abington; in which I was exercised in a line of close fervent
labour, both in the meeting for Ministers and Elders, and the
quarterly meeting at large. It was a season which gave hope
of some improvement in many, but others appeared too much in
a state of <i>self-sufficiency</i>, a most deplorable condition, sickly
and wounded, and which refuses to be healed. For these, my
mind felt pained. O, that they might, ere the day of their
visitation pass over, witness their eyes anointed with the eyesalve
of the gospel, that so they might be brought to see the precipice
on which they stand, and be thereby reduced into the
valley of humiliation; where alone true honour and right exaltation
are known, and where they might experience a being
washed from all their pollutions, and healed of all their wounds.</p>

<p>We attended a meeting at Byberry on sixth day, and, through
the Lord’s presiding presence, it proved a day of signal favour.
The doctrines of full and complete redemption from sin and death
were clearly opened, and truth exalted over all the dark tenets,
and carnal reasonings of men, which lead to unbelief and
infidelity.</p>

<p>On seventh day we returned to Abington, where we had
another large favoured meeting, wherein many things were
opened in a plain way, tending to gather the minds of the people
out of the spirit of the world, which leads to strife and contention,
from whence party animosities arise, often a prelude to war; and
calling their attention home to the great gospel privilege, the
holy <i>unction</i> and <i>anointing within</i>: so that they need not that
any man teach them, but as the same anointing teacheth;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[Pg 93]</span>
which, as they come to believe in and obey, would qualify them
to judge of all ministry, and from whence it had its rise and
spring; and thereby be delivered from all false glosses and mixtures
in religion, and become established in that which never fell,
the immoveable rock Christ Jesus, against which the gates of hell
will never be able to prevail.</p>

<p>On first day, the 10th of 5th month, we attended Horsham
meeting, and in the afternoon, the meeting at North Wales. It
was a day of high favour, the Lord’s arm was graciously made
bare for our help; and the meetings were very large, many not
of our society attended. The gospel was freely preached among
them, in the clear demonstration of the spirit. They were truly
humbling seasons, especially the former, wherein a great number
were much contrited, and wept freely. The rocks seemed to
melt at the presence of the mighty God of Jacob, whose power
was prevalently witnessed in that large assembly, to the praise
and exaltation of his great and glorious name.</p>

<p>We attended the meeting at Plymouth on second day. Although
there was an evident want, affectingly manifest, of that
primitive zeal and integrity which distinguished our worthy
predecessors, with too many of those, who fill up their places in
outward profession; yet it was comforting to find, that the Shepherd
of Israel was still graciously pleased to continue his merciful
visitations, and renew his gracious calls to these, to return,
and renew covenant with him. This was the substance of this
day’s testimony and labour; may the Master of assemblies make
it effectual, to all that were present of this description, is my
sincere prayer. On third day we were at Providence meeting,
which was small; nevertheless, through gracious regard, it
proved an edifying, heart-tendering season. The states of the
people were opened and spoken to, in the authority of truth, to
their great humiliation; many hearts were much broken and
reduced, and the Lord’s power exalted over all.</p>

<p>After this meeting, my mind was turned towards the quarterly
meeting of Caln, to be held this time at Sadsbury, a newly established
quarterly meeting, in the county of Chester. Finding it
necessary to comply with the motion, believing my peace con<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[Pg 94]</span>sisted
in it, we set out immediately after dinner, having thirty
miles, or upwards, to ride to it. The journey proved very wearisome
to my infirm body, being much troubled at this time
with a painful complaint, with which I was greatly afflicted during
the time of this quarterly meeting, especially in the forepart of
the public meeting, preceding the meeting for discipline. I was
ready to conclude that I should be obliged to leave the meeting,
my distress of body was so great; but feeling my mind drawn to
the people, there being a large congregation present, I continued,
and way opening, I was enlarged in clear, pertinent doctrine.
Truth rose into dominion, in an eminent manner, and ran over
all as oil, comforting and breaking many hearts, and reducing,
and silencing every opposite spirit. A very precious solemnity
was spread over the meeting, rejoicing the upright in heart,
relieving to my own mind, and alleviating my bodily affliction.
These are high favours; may an humbling and grateful sense
thereof rest continually upon thee, O my soul, and mayest thou
never forget how much thou owest to thy Lord, how deep and
solemn are thy obligations to the God of thy salvation; how
hath he often taken thee out of the horrible pit, and out of the
miry clay, and set thee upon a rock, and put a new song into
thy mouth, even praises, high praises to him.</p>

<p>From this meeting we returned to Caln, and attended their
monthly meeting, held the sixth of the week. I was enabled to
labour among them in much plainness, both in the meeting for
worship, and for discipline; and left them with a peaceful mind.
The three following days we attended meetings at Robinson,
Exeter, and Reading. The number of members which constituted
these meetings was small, but a considerable number of
the neighbouring inhabitants attended. Ability was graciously
afforded to preach the gospel freely in each, and the power
attending broke and tendered many hearts, and an excellent
savour and solemnity was felt to spread over the meetings, in an
eminent manner; for which I was made humbly thankful to the
bountiful Author of all our blessings. These favours were more
than an adequate reward for all my toil and exercise; although
I had been, for some days past, under the pressure of much bodily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[Pg 95]</span>
infirmity, accompanied with seasons of great uneasiness and pain;
but the Lord’s power was over all, and kept my mind in patience,
and sweet peace from day to day; blessed for ever, be his right
worthy name.</p>

<p>The fourth of the week, and the 20th of 5th month, we
attended the meeting at Maiden Creek. The same afternoon,
and the next day, we crossed the Blue Mountains to Roaring
Creek; and the day after, attended a meeting there. Both of
these meetings were crowned with the Lord’s presence, and were
edifying and instructive seasons. The morning following we
rode to Catawissa, and attended their monthly meeting; and continued
there until after their first day meeting. I was enabled,
through the Lord’s good presence attending, to labour among
them, both in the meeting for discipline, and those for worship,
in much plainness; divers matters relative to the well-ordering
of the affairs of truth were opened, which proved instructive
and edifying.</p>

<p>After the latter meeting, we passed on that afternoon fifteen
miles to Berwick, crossing the river Susquehannah in our way.
The day following, the 25th of 5th month, although my bodily
indisposition still continued, we had a meeting there, among the
town’s people, and the few Friends of that place. It was a comfortable
season, edifying and strengthening to Friends; and
confirming to a number who were looking towards us with
desires for further information. After this meeting, we rode
to Fishing Creek, about eighteen miles; and the day following
had a very satisfactory meeting at that place. Although in this
journey, for a considerable time past, I have experienced much
bodily infirmity; yet the Lord, in his abundant mercy, hath been
graciously pleased to keep my mind stayed upon him. My trust
and confidence have not at any time failed, not even when I
have been reduced into a state of great distress and suffering;
and my poor soul plunged into the mighty abyss of surrounding
darkness, and sunk, as it were, to the bottom of the mountains:
for as I patiently abode under those trying baptisms, and was
made willing to endure my portion thereof, my spirit was raised
out of this horrible pit; wherein I had been a partaker with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[Pg 96]</span>
suffering seed in the hearts of those, who, through supineness,
ease, forgetfulness, unbelief and a worldly spirit, had become
like a bottomless abyss of corruption, darkness and errour: and
I was enabled, through a real feeling of their deplorable states,
to administer to their several wants, and open to them their condition.
Many were reached in heart, and convinced of the errour
of their ways, and were led to give God the glory of his own
work. And, O, saith my soul, may all those who are sent out
on this solemn embassy and most important service, dwell low
in their minds, and keep a single eye to the Lord’s honour, that
so self may be thoroughly abased: otherwise, there is great danger,
in those trying and most afflictive dispensations, of the mind
getting into a state of impatience, and therein be led to judge the
people of hardness, and a spirit of opposition. This will not fail,
if given way to, of centering the minds of such, either into a state
of silent sadness and discouragement, that, like the disciples
formerly, they will be for sending the people away fasting, and
empty; or else raise in them a hot fiery zeal, in which they will
throw out some hard censures, or harsh reproof, untempered with
that charity, requisite and necessary always to attend every
gospel communication: for want of which, both speaker and
hearers will be wounded, much hurt done, and many opportunities,
I believe, have been entirely lost by these means, which
might have been crowned with the Lord’s presence, and his truth
exalted. Nay I have no doubt, but some meetings have been
held to the dishonour of truth, and wounding many tender
minds. And I have sometimes been afraid, that some, who
are rightly called, and sent on this greatest of errands, have so far
missed their way, while under some of those excruciating baptisms,
which they have been led into, in order to qualify them
rightly to administer to the states of the people, as to suffer an
impatient spirit to rise up; and have thus brought a gloom of
darkness over their minds, which has continued with them from
day to day, greatly to their distress. Although they have continued
to attend meetings, they have been so shut up in total
darkness, as not to see any way of relief, except in uttering their
complaints, similar to the murmurings of Israel in the wilder<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[Pg 97]</span>ness.
Where I have found such things left on record, I have
thought they always tended to discouragement and dismay,
when coming from the leaders of the people. Although the
Lord was graciously pleased to condescend to the weakness of
Israel, and deliver them out of the distress which their impatience
had brought upon them; yet he very clearly manifested
his displeasure thereat. And if only one instance of impatience
and improper zeal in Moses drew upon him such severe censure,
as we read it did, how ought all those, who are now called forth
as leaders of the people, to stand always on their guard against
every motion of impatience, and impure zeal, lest they also fall
under the displeasure of the Captain of their salvation.</p>

<p>Although, after those gloomy dispensations, we may be again
favoured, in renewed mercy, and helped out of this horrible pit,
and witness the lifting up of the light of the Lord’s glorious countenance
upon us; yet this is no proof of the rectitude of our
conduct, any more than his showing mercy to Israel, after their
murmurings, was a justification thereof. Yet I have been afraid,
that some have considered those renewed favours, as a consequence
of their own sufferings; which, to me, carries too much
of selfishness, and savours of a desire of clothing ourselves with
the Lord’s jewels, instead of rendering to him, with heart-felt
gratitude, the glory of all his works; and receiving this act of
unmerited redemption from the gloom, our own impatience, and
the want of a thorough reduction of self, had cast us into, as
flowing purely from his forbearing mercy, condescending goodness
and free love.</p>

<p>After the aforesaid meeting, we rode to Muncy, and lodged
with our kind friend William Ellis. The next day, the fourth
of the week, and the 27th of 5th month, their meeting was held;
and notice being spread that we were there, it was large. Although
I had to sit some time in the forepart of the meeting, in
much weakness and depression, both of body and mind; yet as
I abode in patience and resignation to my allotment, willing to be
any thing, or nothing, and to do, or to suffer, according to the
Master’s will; after a time of solemn waiting, a little opening
presented, attended with some glimmering of light; and as my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[Pg 98]</span>
eye was kept steadily to it, I felt a necessity to stand up; and as
I proceeded in guarded care, it opened to a large field of doctrine,
suitably adapted, I believe, to the states of those present. A very
comfortable solemnity was felt to spread over the meeting, rejoicing
the hearts of the faithful.</p>

<p>We rested for a day or two after this meeting, with our aforesaid
friend, in order to recruit, feeling myself very unwell with a
cold, which had attended me for some time; and being much
worn down by constant travelling under such bodily infirmities.
The 30th of the month, and seventh day of the week, we attended
a meeting at a place called Pine Grove; a small meeting of
Friends being held there. On first day we had a large meeting,
by appointment, at a town called Williamsport, which was held
in their court-house; but the room was not large enough to contain
the people, and although very much crowded, and many
standing, they behaved soberly, and a blessed meeting we had.
I was led forth among them, in a large affecting testimony,
wherein the truths of the gospel were clearly opened and explained
to the weakest capacities, and the Lord’s power was in dominion,
in a very eminent manner. It was a season thankfully to be
remembered, and greatly refreshing to my drooping spirit, making
up every deficiency for the want of bodily health. I could with
heart-felt gratitude cheerfully acknowledge, it was the Lord’s
doing.</p>

<p>After this meeting we set forward on our journey towards
Redstone, having meetings in our way, at Job Packers, Milesburgh,
Half-moon Valley, and Downing’s Creek. Then we
passed directly over the Alleghany mountains, into the compass
of Redstone quarterly meeting. On fourth day, the 10th of 6th
month, we attended a meeting at Sewickly, on the western side
of the mountains, a branch of Redstone monthly meeting. After
this, we were at Providence on fifth day, Center on sixth, and
Fallowfield on seventh day. Although these were seasons of
close exercise, accompanied with some painful labour, and deep
baptisms, in suffering with the seed; yet my mind was favoured
in the openings of gospel light, so to discharge myself in those
meetings, as to leave them with solid peace of mind. I believe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[Pg 99]</span>
they were seasons of renewed visitation to many who attended,
that will not soon be forgotten by them.</p>

<p>On first day we attended the meeting at Pike Run, and the
two following days were at Westland, and Redstone meetings.
My mind was under a very great pressure of distress, in passing
along through those six last mentioned meetings; both from an
inward sense, and an outward discovery, of great weakness prevailing
among them; occasioned by an unwarrantable credulity,
and letting out their minds to listen to, and believe in, the vulgar,
and shamefully ridiculous notion of witchcraft. Some of
their leading members openly acknowledged, they believed that a
family of their near kindred, several of whom were troubled with
a kind of periodical fits, were actually thus affected by one of
their neighbours. My spirit was exceedingly grieved by their
asserting their belief in those abominable reports, and by discovering
how their minds were led away thereby; and my grief was
also much increased by their confidence in a certain boy in the
neighbourhood, who pretended to tell secrets, saying, that he could
see persons whom any should inquire after, although in a very
distant part of the world, and would tell those who came to see
him, notwithstanding they lived on the other side of the Atlantic,
that he could see the very place of their residence, and of what
materials their houses were made, as if he was present at the place;
and would pretend to tell the conditions and dispositions of persons,
whom he had never before seen, and what they were guilty
of, as to their private sins, and who was a witch, and who not; and
he had so far got the ascendency in the minds of those who had
given way to the absurd notion of witchcraft, that whatever he
said, in these respects, obtained their implicit belief. And if he
impeached the most unblemished character of being a witch, or
charged such with being guilty of any baneful sin, they were
ready to believe it; by which means great hurt was done. I
was exceedingly burthened therewith, and had conversation with
divers on the subject; but they were so carried away with these
notions, that reasoning seemed to have no weight with them.
While any man or woman can give way to believe in such
things, and go to dark, undisciplined, and irreligious men, to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[Pg 100]</span>
healed of those infirmities, which they are told are the effect of
witchcraft, it is certainly denying the God that made them, who
only hath all power in heaven and in earth, and can wound and
heal, kill and make alive at his pleasure. God forbid, saith my
soul, that any, professing the name of a Friend, should ever thus
desert the God of his salvation; for if he doth, it will no doubt
tend to his confusion, and in which state, he will be given over
to strange delusions, even to believe a lie; a most wretched state
for any poor soul to be in. I was enabled, through condescending
goodness, to clear my mind among them, by divers large full
testimonies to the truth, and the excellency of its power, to deliver
from every thing that tends to hurt or defile.</p>

<p>I left them with peace of mind, and proceeded to Connelstown,
where we had a very comfortable heart-tendering season, among
a few Friends, and the town’s people. Next we attended Sandy
Hill meeting; and the day following were at Sandy Creek
Glades, both comfortable seasons. These closed our visit to
Redstone quarterly meeting. We then returned across the Alleghany
mountains, with a view to attend the meetings belonging
to Hopewell, in the compass of Fairfax Quarterly meeting. We
reached Bear Garden particular meeting on first day, having
rode diligently the day before, for that purpose; not having
much prospect thereof when we left Sandy Creek. The distance
between the two places was about ninety-two miles, and
the way very mountainous, and having had but little more than
a day and a half to ride it. This meeting, in the forepart, was
heavy, but ended well; and we left them with solid satisfaction,
and passed on to Back Creek meeting that afternoon; held near
a small town, or village, called Penn’s Town. Many of the
neighbouring people came in, so that the meeting was pretty
large, and I had considerable to communicate among them, but
without obtaining much relief of mind.</p>

<p>In the course of this week we attended meetings at the Ridge,
Centre, Crooked Run, Mount Pleasant, Hopewell, and Lower
Ridge; and on the first and second days, of the following week,
we were at Middle Creek, and Berkly meetings. These were,
most of them, favoured seasons, particularly that at Middle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[Pg 101]</span>
Creek, wherein the Lord’s presence was powerfully manifest.
Truth rose into great dominion, preciously uniting and edifying
the honest-hearted, and breaking down all opposition, affecting
and mollifying the hearts of, almost, the whole assembly. It was
indeed a precious solemnity, not soon to be forgotten, but to be
held in grateful remembrance.</p>

<p>After those meetings, we turned our faces homewards, attending
meetings in our way, at Little York, Columbia, Pottstown,
and the Great Swamp, alias Richland; these were through
divine favour, instructive seasons. The next meeting was at
Plumbstead, in the compass of Buck’s quarterly meeting, which
we attended on third day, the 7th of 7th month: and on the
two following days, we were at Buckingham, and Wright’s
Town meetings. My mind, in those meetings, was brought
under a close exercise, from a prospect of Friends being too much
leavened into the spirit of the world, its customs and maxims;
by which, many appeared to be greatly wounded, and had become
as dwarfs in our Israel. And I believe, nothing contributed
more to this, than their becoming parties in the civil government,
and taking offices therein; for here, the spirit of contention gets
in, and a striving to be uppermost, and fill the principal seats:
then party animosities take place, from whence are derived envy
and jealousy, one against another; and then reviling, and
neighbours speaking evil of each other; hence wars and fightings
arise, as from their natural ground. As any give way to
these things, it leavens their minds into the spirit of the world,
which is a spirit of darkness, that blinds the understanding and
hardens the heart, and draws into many hurtful and pernicious
practices, such as dealing in ardent spirits, drinking strong drink,
and handing it out in their fields to their workmen, to stimulate
them to an excess of labour; hence an excess of drinking strong
drink is gradually introduced among the poor labourers, by means
of which many families are ruined.</p>

<p>My spirit was deeply exercised on those accounts, but as I
patiently endured the baptisms I had to go through, and submitted
to communicate what appeared clearly to open; I was enlarged
in setting forth the dangerous and hurtful tendency of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[Pg 102]</span>
such conduct, and its great inconsistency with our holy profession,
and to exhort Friends to a more frequent recurrence to the first
principle of our profession, the light within; whereby deliverance
and preservation could only be experienced. The Lord was
graciously with us in those meetings, and the faithful were encouraged
and edified, and many hearts greatly tendered, under
a sense of the Lord’s mercy and goodness extended to us in these
seasons.</p>

<p>On sixth day we attended a meeting at Makefield, and in the
afternoon, had a large meeting at Newtown. It was held in
their court-house, and mostly composed of those not professing
with us. I felt in this meeting, the pressure and prevalence of a
spirit of darkness and unbelief; and was led to open the ground
thereof, and to show its inconsistency with the self-evident experience
of every rational mind. For although men in the ignorance
and darkness of their own hearts, may strive to settle themselves
in unbelief, in order to live quietly in the gratification of
their own wills and creaturely appetites, without any controul;
yet, they never can fully come to this; for that just witness,
placed in every bosom as a reprover for sin, will continue to disturb
all those false rests, and shake every heaven of man’s
making. For although men, through the hardness of their
hearts, may not submit to the guidance of this just principle, so
as to have a saving belief therein; yet they will thereby be
compelled into a belief, similar to that of the devils, and which
they will never be able fully to divest themselves of by all their
carnal reasonings and fleshly wisdom; but it will continue, at
times, to make them fear and tremble, and by its tremendous
power will cause the very top of their Sinai to shake, and blast
all their false hopes. For it is the determinate counsel of unerring
wisdom, that the hope of the hypocrite shall perish: therefore
let all prize the day of their visitation, while the Lord is
graciously striving with them, by the clear, self-evident touches
of his light in their hearts; in order that the wicked may turn
from his wicked way, and the unrighteous from his unrighteous
thoughts, and turn unto the Lord who will have mercy upon
him, and unto our God, who will abundantly pardon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p>The meeting at Makefield was likewise a precious opportunity.
The Lord being mightily with us in our passing along, from
season to season, to our humbling admiration, furnishing with
strength for every service; so that we indeed found him to be
strength in weakness, and riches in poverty. For I never felt
greater weakness and nothingness, as to self, than in this journey;
and could truly say, that our sufficiency was not of ourselves,
but of God; and that the Lord was our strength from
day to day, who is over all, blessed for ever.</p>

<p>The three following days we attended meetings at Middletown,
Bristol, and the Falls. I was led forth in these meetings to
show wherein real Christianity consists; and although the people
of christendom had the name of Christians, yet, so long as
they lived in the gratification of their own wills and carnal lusts,
from whence discord, animosities, envyings, strife and every evil
work originated, they were only heathens in disguise. For
true Christianity is nothing else than a real and complete mortification
of our own wills, and a full and final annihilation of all
self-exaltation: and the contrary is the true antichrist, that
sitteth in the seat of God, who opposeth and exalteth himself
above all that is called God, or that is worshipped. Therefore,
none are any further Christians, than as they come to experience
the self-denial, meekness, humility and gentleness of
Christ, ruling and reigning in them, so as to become their real
life; and in, and by which, they become partakers of the divine
nature, and know the <i>life of God</i> raised up in the immortal
soul; which is the new birth, or <i>Christ formed in us</i>, and
without which, as our Lord told Nicodemus, no man can see the
kingdom of God.</p>

<p>After these meetings we crossed the river Delaware into New
Jersey, attending meetings on our way, at Kingwood, Hardwick,
Mendham, and one near Paulingskiln. From thence we passed
to Cornwall, in the state of New-York. We reached there
seventh day evening, the 18th of 7th month, and the next day
were at their first day meeting. I was much worn down by
constant travelling and hard labour, and felt much fatigue when
we came here; and in going to this meeting, I felt a desire to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[Pg 104]</span>
rise in my mind, that I might have a good silent meeting. The
prayer of my spirit was answered, for I had not sat long before a
perfect, sweet calm ensued, wherein my whole man was swallowed
up in divine seraphic enjoyment; so that not only my
mind, but also my wearied body forgot all its toil; and my soul
was so inflamed with gratitude, to the all-bountiful Author of all
our rich mercies and blessings, that praises and thanksgiving
ascended as incense from the altar of my heart to his great and
glorious name, who remains to be God over all, blessed for ever,
world without end. Amen.</p>

<p>In the course of this week we attended meetings at Newburgh
Valley, the Paltz, Marlborough, and on fifth day were at Cornwall
monthly meeting. The meeting for worship which preceded
the business, was large. I was led among them in a line of
close searching labour, which, for some time, seemed to have but
little entrance among them; mankind being too generally disposed,
while in a state of unsoundness, to shut themselves against
<i>that</i>, which they know, if they are open to receive, would find out
all their secret lurking places, where <i>self-love</i> and <i>self-will</i> lie
shrouded under a mask <i>of doing good</i>, while it is gratified in
the full enjoyment of all its beloveds, and with whom it is daily
committing adultery and fornication: but as I continued to persevere
in faithfulness to the opening, although the prospect for a
time seemed discouraging, truth began to make way by its own
power, and gradually spread over the meeting, breaking down
all opposition, and tendering and mollifying many hearts. The
meeting for discipline appeared to be pretty well conducted, there
being, I believe, a remnant honestly engaged for the promotion
of the cause of truth; and these the Lord delights to favour, and
furnish with strength to carry on his own work of truth and
righteousness in the earth; and he will continue to reward these
with the real enjoyment of his life-giving presence; while those
who sit as mere idle spectators, will be sent empty away.</p>

<p>On sixth day we had an appointed meeting at the house of
our friend Thomas Jones at Walkiln; on seventh day, one at
Goshen, and on first day, we were at Smith’s Clove. All satisfactory
seasons, especially the last, wherein truth was powerfully<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[Pg 105]</span>
manifest, tendering the hearts of the people in a remarkable
manner; so that a very precious solemnity was witnessed to
spread over the meeting. After these meetings we turned homewards,
attending meetings in our way at Kakiat, Tappan and
New-York. We reached home on fourth day evening, the 29th
of 7th month. I found my family in usual health, which, together
with an endeared and cordial reception in the feelings
of mutual love, and flowings of that peace of mind attendant on
a faithful discharge of manifested duty, filled my heart with
thankful acknowledgments to the great and bountiful Author
of every blessing.</p>

<p>I was from home in this journey three months and eighteen
days, and travelled about sixteen hundred and thirty miles.</p>

<p>In the fall of the year 1803, I performed a visit to Friends of
Upper Canada, and some other of the northwestern parts of our
yearly meeting. Daniel Titus was my companion in this journey.
We left home the 20th of 9th month, and proceeded
directly to Canada, in company with two other Friends, who,
with us, were appointed to attend the monthly meeting of Adolphustown
on a particular concern relative to that meeting. We
were at but three meetings in our way thither, two at Hudson
on first day, and one at Black River. We got well to Adolphustown
on third day evening, the 3d of 10th month, having
rode about four hundred and ten miles, and crossed the great
river St. Lawrence, which appeared to be a dangerous passage.
We crossed its two branches, an island lying in the middle.
Each branch was nearly five miles over. We passed the latter
in the middle of the night, by the light of the moon, in two small
flat-bottomed boats, one of them so small as to carry only one
horse. This latter passage lay open to Lake Ontario, and the
wind being from that quarter, caused the swell frequently to
wash into our boats, so that we had considerable labour to throw
out the water as fast as it came in; but my confidence was in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[Pg 107]</span>
Him, who hath the winds and the waves at his command. This
kept out fear, and we got safe over about one o’clock in the
morning.</p>

<p>On fourth day we attended Friends’ meeting at Adolphustown,
as it came in course, which proved an instructive favoured season.
On fifth day we rode to Green Point, in the township of
Sophiasburgh, to the house of our friend Daniel Way; and had
an appointed meeting there that afternoon, at the third hour. In
this meeting I was favoured; and by the prevalence of the power
of truth, attending the communication, many minds were much
bowed, and their hearts tendered by its secret mollifying influence.
Our next appointment was in the neighbourhood of our
friend Robert Hubbs, on seventh day, composed mostly of people
not of our society, which was a comfortable, edifying season.
After this we proceeded to the township of Hallowell, to the
house of our friend Thomas Boorman near West Lake; and on
first day attended Friends’ meeting there. On second day, we
had an opportunity with the people at the east end of the lake,
which was held at the house of a professor among the Methodists.
These two last meetings were eminently favoured; truth
rose into dominion, and ran as oil over all opposition, to the
instruction and comfort of many minds; and the Lord was
praised for his goodness, and for his merciful, loving kindness to
the children of men. We returned that evening to the west end
of said lake, to the house of our friend Jacob Cronk, and lodged.</p>

<p>On third day the 11th of 10th month, we returned to the
house of Cornelius Blount, where the meeting for Friends of
West Lake was held. It was the time of their preparative meeting,
and many of the neighbouring inhabitants came in, and
sat with Friends, during the time of worship; the forepart of
which, was rather low and depressing; but as patience was
abode in, and right attention given to a small opening which
presented, and as I moved therein with care, truth gradually rose
into dominion, powerfully breaking down all that stood in its
way. Many hearts were comforted and refreshed, and a general
solemnity spread over the meeting, so that we could truly say,
hitherto hath the Lord helped us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>After the preparative meeting was over, which was held in an
orderly manner, we returned that evening to the house of our
friend John Dorland, in Adolphustown, he having kindly accompanied
us since we left that place. On fourth day we
attended the preparative meeting there. The meeting for worship
was large, many of those who were not members came in,
and manifested great willingness to hear the truths of the gospel
declared; yet too many appeared careless and unconcerned, with
regard to the practical part, so that in them was fulfilled the saying
of the apostle: “For if any be a hearer of the word, and not
a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a
glass: for he beholdeth himself and goeth his way, and straightway
forgetteth what manner of man he was.” And this, it is
to be feared, is too much the case with many amongst us, as a
people, who are pleasing themselves with hearing the truth declared,
and rejoice in the privilege of sitting under a free, living,
gospel ministry, through the labour and exercise of the faithful;
but suffer the cumbering cares and pleasures of this life, so to
divert them from a right improvement of their own gifts, that
they, in a religious sense, may justly be compared to idle drones,
who live on the labour of the industrious bee, and are contenting
themselves in a situation like the foolish virgins, who, although
they have lamps, yet, are without oil in their vessels; but alas,
what will these do, when the awful midnight cry is heard, “behold
the bridegroom cometh;” then fear and dismay, with an utter
exclusion from the marriage chamber, will be the woful doom of
all careless, and lifeless professors. O that all might lay these
things to heart, and endeavour, in awful fear, to have their day’s
work done in the day time; for behold the night cometh, wherein
none can work.</p>

<p>On sixth day we attended Friends’ preparative meeting at
Kingston; and on seventh day, we had a meeting in the town
of Kingston, in the court-house, the first Friends’ meeting ever
held in that place. The people appeared much unacquainted
with the order of our meetings, and some of the principal men
seemed at a loss how to behave themselves in the time of silence;
but during the communication, they were generally quiet and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[Pg 109]</span>
solemn, and truth rose into victory, furnishing doctrine, clothed
with divine power, and carrying conviction to the minds of most
present.</p>

<p>The next day, the first of the week, we again attended Friends’
meeting held at the house of the widow Brewer; they not having
any meeting-house in this place. In the afternoon we had an
appointed meeting in the west part of this township, on the bay,
which was held at the house of John Everit, a man not in strict
profession with any religious society. These were both seasons
of heavenly refreshment; the life ran as oil over all; many
hearts were much broken and contrited, under the precious mollifying
influence thereof; praised and magnified for ever, be the
name of the Lord, for his mercy and loving kindness to the
children of men.</p>

<p>The 17th we returned towards Adolphustown, and attended
a meeting appointed at an inn on our way, in the town of Earnest.
This also proved, through the condescending mercy and
goodness of the Lord our gracious helper, a blessed season; and
through the efficacious power attending the word preached, many
hearts were pierced, and the whole assembly solemnized. We
parted from each other with thankful hearts, and rode to Adolphustown,
and lodged with our friend Daniel Haight. The day
following we had an appointed meeting at his house, for the
neighbouring inhabitants, who were, many of them, professors
among the Methodists. This, through divine goodness, was to
me a season of great refreshment, and the assembly were generally
broken and contrited by the convicting power of divine
love, which was mercifully vouchsafed to us at this season.</p>

<p>We then proceeded again to our friend John Dorland’s, and
rested the next day, as I was somewhat unwell, and considerably
wearied by such constant travelling.</p>

<p>On fifth day, the 20th of the month, we attended Friends’
monthly meeting for the lower part of the Province of Upper
Canada, held at Adolphustown. This closed our visit in these
parts; and we took leave of our friends in much brotherly
affection; their hearts were contrited, and their cheeks bedewed
with tears, when we closed our farewell addresses. After this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[Pg 110]</span>
we rode directly to Kingston about thirty-five miles, and there took
boat immediately, and crossed one branch of the river St. Lawrence
that evening. We likewise crossed the island, which lies
between, before dark, it being about five miles over; but as the
wind was unfavourable, we did not cross the other branch till
next morning. We lodged in a small house, being the only one
on that side of the island. Our accommodations were very poor,
having to lie on the floor, and on benches; but having the best
of company, peace of mind, and a firm trust in the divine blessing,
it kept us comfortable and pleasant.</p>

<p>The next day, the 22d of the month, we crossed early in the
morning, and rode that day, to our friend Samuel Brown’s, at
Black River. The day after, being the first of the week, we
tarried there, and had two meetings with his family, and the
neighbours; divers of whom were sober religious Baptists. They
were both favoured seasons; may the Lord bless his own work,
and seal it to the lasting advantage of those who attended.</p>

<p>The 24th and 25th, we rode eighty-five miles to Utica, on the
upper part of the Mohawk river. The 26th, 27th and 28th, we
rode about one hundred and eighteen miles to Palmyra, in Ontario
county, to the house of our friend Abraham Lapham. The
29th we rested. The 30th, being the first of the week, we
attended Friends’ meeting in that neighbourhood, and one in the
evening, appointed at a man’s house whose wife was a member,
about six miles distant from the former. They were both, I believe,
profitable and edifying seasons. The 31st we attended a
meeting in the town of Palmyra, appointed principally for those
not of our society. It was a large solemn meeting, wherein the
truths of the gospel were largely opened, affecting, solemnizing
and comforting many hearts.</p>

<p>On the 1st of the 11th month, we rode to Bristol about eighteen
miles, and attended a meeting at the third hour in the
afternoon. It was held in a Baptist meeting-house, and was a
hard exercising season. Those who attended appeared to be
mostly, very insensible of any right religious concern and exercise;
nevertheless, through ability received, after a considerable
time of hard silent labour, the power of truth was exalted among<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[Pg 111]</span>
them, and some hearts were reached and tendered thereby, and I
left them with peace of mind.</p>

<p>We then rode back thirty-seven miles to Cayuga Lake, and
lodged at an inn. On the 3d, we rode to a town called
Scipio, where a few Friends resided, who were indulged with
holding a meeting under the care of the monthly meeting of
Farmington. Here we had a meeting at the eleventh hour, it
being their usual meeting day. It was very small and low in
the silent part, but as a right exercise in waiting, was patiently
maintained, truth gradually rose into dominion, in a very instructive
manner, refreshing and comforting our minds, in the sweet
enjoyment of the divine presence, who manifested himself to be
graciously near for our help in the needful time.</p>

<p>After dining with our friends we took leave, and turned our
faces homeward; and in four days got to Galloway, to the house
of our friend Philip Macomber. The next day we rested. The
three following days we attended the meetings of Galloway,
Ballstown, and Newtown; which were all comfortable edifying
seasons. The 12th we rode to Troy. The 13th, and first of the
week, we attended two meetings, the first, at the eleventh hour,
at the house of Zachariah Garnrick, about four miles from Troy,
where the few Friends of that place and the adjacent neighbourhood,
hold a little meeting. It was enlarged at this time by
others coming in, who were not of our society; and the Lord
rewarded us bountifully, and gave us a heavenly season together,
wherein his name was gloriously exalted over all; and we parted
with thankful hearts. The latter meeting was held at Troy,
in their court-house. It was a large gathering, but hard and
heavy.</p>

<p>The 14th we rode to Pittstown, and attended a meeting at the
second hour, which was a satisfactory season, and, I hope, profitable
to some; although others appeared to be too much at ease.
The 15th we rode to Easton, and attended the quarterly meeting
of Ministers and Elders; and the two following days we
attended the quarterly meeting for discipline, and the parting
meeting for worship. The latter was a heavenly baptizing season,
wherein truth was raised into dominion in a very eminent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[Pg 112]</span>
manner, the hearts of many were much broken and contrited, and
a general solemnity spread over the meeting; and the Lord’s name
praised, and exalted over all, who is worthy for ever.</p>

<p>After this, we rode that afternoon to Saratoga, crossing the
river Hudson in our way; and the next day went to South
Greenfield, and attended a meeting at the second hour in the
afternoon. The 19th we rode to Providence, and after a meeting
there, went back again that afternoon to North Greenfield.
The day following, being the first of the week, we attended a
meeting there, which was large and favoured, as were the two
former. The 21st, we had an appointed meeting at Saratoga
Springs, amongst a people not very unlike those, whom the
scribes, among the Jews, called publicans and sinners. It was a
profitable edifying season, most of those present appearing to
receive the word with readiness, and apparent good will; so that
it might have been said of some of them, as our Lord said concerning
some of this description in his day, that they were more
likely to enter the kingdom, than many of the high professors of
religion, who make a great outward show of godliness, but are
void of the power.</p>

<p>The 23d and 24th, we attended the monthly meetings of Saratoga
and Easton; and the day following had an appointed
meeting at White Creek, and the next day we rode to East
Hoosack. The 27th, and first of the week, we attended Friends’
meeting there. It was a very comfortable season; the Lord was
with us, and by his power made way in the hearts of the people,
for the reception of the testimony given us to bear among them.
We left them with thankful hearts, and rode that evening to our
friend David Lapham’s, in the township of Hancock; and the
next day had a meeting at his house, at the second hour, for
the neighbouring inhabitants, who were mostly professors among
the Baptists, and who behaved very orderly; and the Lord, in
his never failing mercy, favoured us together with a solemn
instructive season.</p>

<p>The next day we passed on to New Britain, and rested the
following day. The fifth of the week, and the 1st of 12th month,
we attended the meeting there, at its usual time; which was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[Pg 113]</span>
very large, occasioned, in part, by our being there; and there
was likewise a marriage accomplished thereat. I think, for the
most part, it was a favoured, comfortable season. On sixth day
we attended a meeting at Kline Kiln; and on first day were at
Hudson, where we had, with Friends and others, at their meeting,
a refreshing opportunity; the Lord was graciously near,
furnishing with strength and utterance, and an evidence of the
divine power attending, rejoicing the faithful, confirming the
weak and wavering, and convicting the indolent, the disobedient,
and gainsayers. On second day we rode to Little Nine Partners;
and the four following days, we attended meetings at that
place, Pine Plains, Stanford, and Creek; these were comfortable
meetings, wherein, through the prevalence of truth, many
were convicted, their hearts tendered, and the faithful few encouraged,
and made to rejoice; and the Lord’s name praised and
exalted over all. On seventh day evening we had an appointed
meeting at the house of Thomas Wilbur, about four miles from
the latter; and although hard and low, yet I trust in a good
degree profitable and instructive.</p>

<p>On first day we went to Crum-elbow meeting, which was very
much crowded, and the house not sufficient to hold the people.
The season appeared somewhat to represent the time, when the
miracle of the loaves and fishes was performed. For the people’s
attention appeared to be generally outward, many having
come together out of curiosity, to see and hear with their outward
senses; which makes hard work for the travellers, who are
faithfully engaged in Zion’s cause. I sat long in silence in
great poverty and want, for the people appeared to be void of any
spiritual food, and no offering prepared; but as I abode in
patience, and in the faith, the query ran through my mind, is
there not a lad present, who may have a few barley loaves and
fishes. A young man soon after stood up, who, I believed, had
for some time, something on his mind to offer; and by a short
but pertinent communication opened my way. Soon after he
sat down I stood up, and the Lord made way among the people,
while I was led to open, in a very enlarged manner, what the
young Friend had dropped; and the Lord’s power was extended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[Pg 114]</span>
in a marvellous manner over the whole assembly, so that it might
be said indeed, that all did eat and were filled, and many fragments
remained to be gathered up. It was the Lord’s doing,
and marvellous in our eyes.</p>

<p>Our two next appointments were at Pleasant Valley, and the
Branch, on second and third days. These were comfortable,
and I trust, profitable seasons. The four successive days we
attended the monthly meetings of Oswego, Nine Partners, Creek,
and Stanford. They were all seasons of great favour, wherein
I was largely opened in the line of gospel ministry, in four
several searching testimonies, greatly to the comfort of the honest
faithful travellers, and to the rebuke and warning of the careless,
hypocritical, and worldly-minded professors. On first day we
attended the meeting at Nine Partners, and notice having been
previously given of our intention of being there, the meeting was
very large; and the Lord’s power was present with us, enabling
me to discharge myself faithfully among them, and instructingly
to divide the word, suited to their several conditions. The season
concluded with prayer and thanksgiving, to his great and adorable
name, who is over all, God blessed for ever.</p>

<p>After this, apprehending I felt liberty to turn my face homeward,
and having for the two successive days meetings, appointed
at Chesnut Ridge, and <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Poquague">Poughquague</span>, we proceeded accordingly.
Although I was under considerable infirmity of body, and travelled
in much pain, yet through gracious aid, furnished from
the adorable fountain of all wisdom and strength, I was enabled
to attend them to my own satisfaction, and the comfort and
encouragement of my friends. I was led forth in both of these
meetings in large affecting testimonies; the minds of many
present were baptized and humbled, and the faithful few refreshed,
whom the Lord delights to honour.</p>

<p>On fourth day we crossed the Highlands, and rode down to
the mouth of Croton River, about forty-two miles. It was wearisome
to my afflicted body, but believing it right for us so to
proceed, and having faith in the divine sufficiency, I was sustained
even beyond rational expectation. The day following
being Friends’ meeting day in that place, we had a comfortable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[Pg 115]</span>
opportunity with them, together with some of their neighbours;
and it was, I believe, an instructive edifying season to many.
May it fasten as a nail in a sure place.</p>

<p>After this we passed on to New-York, where we tarried over
first day, and attended their forenoon and afternoon meetings;
also an appointed meeting in the evening, at their new meeting-house.
They were large and very exercising, yet, I trust, in the
main, profitable meetings. On second day the 26th of 12th month,
we rode home, and I found my family well, which, together
with the Lord’s mercies and preservations, vouchsafed to me in
this arduous journey, caused my heart to be filled with gratitude
and thanksgiving to His great and worthy name, to whom belongs
all praise, adoration and worship, from the rising of the
sun to the going down of the same, throughout all ages, world
without end. Amen.</p>

<p>I was out in this journey about three months, and rode about
fifteen hundred and seventy-five miles.</p>

<p>In the spring of the year 1806, feeling my mind drawn in
gospel love, to pay a religious visit to some of the neighbouring
towns and villages on our island, Staten Island and New-York,
among those not in profession with us; and opening my concern
to our monthly meeting, I received the concurrence and unity
of my friends therein. I was from home in this service about
twenty days, and had about thirty meetings among those not of
our society, generally to good satisfaction, and to the peace of my
own mind. Many, in most places, appeared convinced of the
truth and propriety of our doctrine and principles, as they were
communicated, and divers feelingly expressed their satisfaction
therewith, and the heart-felt comfort they witnessed in those
opportunities; and I had cause to hope that light was breaking
forth in some places, which had long been under the power of
great darkness, through the undue force of wrong customs, and
a false education, principally propagated by a mercenary, anti-christian
ministry. My mind was often affected, in considering
the emptiness and fruitless state of many of those professors
under different names, who had a form of godliness, and were
very zealous in attending to the outside ceremonials, of what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[Pg 116]</span>
they called religion and worship; but in their lives and conduct
denied the power thereof, being persuaded by their blind guides,
to believe they might be saints, while they were sinners, and
stand in a state of justification, without sanctification. But this
is a false and very dangerous doctrine. O, saith my spirit, may
the light of Israel arise and come forth, and by the brightness of
its arising, dispel all those mists and fogs, those works of darkness,
which those blind guides have raised up between God and
the souls of the people; and deliver the nations out of the hands
of all oppressors, that so none, at the awful closing period, may
witness verified in themselves, that solemn truth, that “if the
blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.”</p>

<p>In the fall of the year 1806, feeling my mind drawn to visit
some parts of the quarterly meetings of Purchase, Nine Partners,
and Stanford, with some adjacent places, not among Friends,
and obtaining the unity and concurrence of our monthly meeting
therein, I set forward the 8th of 12th month; Thomas Willis
kindly joining me as a companion in this journey. On third
day we attended the meeting for sufferings in New-York, and in
the evening we had an appointed meeting at Brooklyn, which
was a solemn, comfortable season. Fourth day, being the day
on which Friends’ meeting was held in the city, notice was
given of our intention of being there. It was a pretty large meeting,
and in a good degree favoured with the spreading of the
divine canopy, and strength was afforded to communicate to the
various situations of those present; to the honest-hearted and
truly exercised travellers, comfort and encouragement, and of
this number, I trust, there are a few preserved in this city of great
stir and commotion; and to the careless, the unguarded and
refractory, caution and rebuke.</p>

<p>After this we passed on to Mamaroneck, and lodged with our
kind friend Richard Mott. The three following days of this week,
we attended the monthly meetings of Purchase, Shapaqua and
Amawalk. We stayed over their first day meeting at Amawalk,
which was large, many of other societies coming in; and had
an appointed meeting in the evening at Peekskill. These were
all seasons of favour, comforting and refreshing to my mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>On second day, the 15th of the month, we proceeded on our
journey, and reached, seasonably in the evening, the house of our
kind friend Enoch Dorland, at or near Oswego. On third day
we rode to Nine Partners. On fourth day we attended the
monthly meeting of Oswego; both the meeting for worship, and
that for discipline, were well conducted, and truth reigned; which
made them comfortable and instructive. On fifth, sixth and
seventh days, we attended the monthly meetings of Nine Partners,
Creek, and Stanford. Nothing transpired in either of these
unusual. We attended Friends’ meeting at Northeast, on first
day, and also a meeting in the evening at Little Nine Partners;
both seasons of favour. On second day we rode to Hudson, and
the next day attended their monthly meeting, and likewise had
a large public meeting in the evening with Friends and others.
I have cause to acknowledge the goodness and mercy of the
Shepherd of Israel, who has been pleased graciously to manifest
his presence and power for our help and encouragement,
from season to season, enabling us to labour, to the comfort and
refreshment of the honest-hearted and faithful among the brethren
and sisters, and to impart counsel and caution to the varied
states of those amongst whom our lots were cast, and stirring up
the pure mind in many. So that in many places it appeared to
be a renewed visitation of divine love to the people, for which
many hearts with our own were made thankful.</p>

<p>On fourth and fifth days we had meetings with Friends at
Kline Kiln, and New Britain; and on sixth day we had an opportunity
with those not in profession with us, at a place called
Philipstown. The meeting was held in a meeting-house belonging
to the Presbyterians, and a precious season it proved,
tendering the hearts of most present; truth prevailing over all,
to the praise and glory of His grace, who hath called us to labour
in his vineyard.</p>

<p>We went from this place to Troy and attended Friends’ meeting
on first day; and had a large public meeting in the evening
with the inhabitants of the town. On second and third day
evenings, we had meetings in the towns of Waterford and Lansingburgh;
the former was held in a meeting-house belonging<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[Pg 118]</span>
to the Methodist society; and the latter, by their voluntary permission,
in the Episcopal meeting-house. These were all seasons
of favour, especially the last, in which truth was powerfully
manifest, solemnizing the assembly, tendering and melting many
hearts into contrition, and raising an acknowledgment to its
divine power.</p>

<p>On fourth day we attended Friends’ preparative meeting at
Troy, and also an appointed meeting for the inhabitants of the
town in the evening. The next morning previous to our leaving
there, we had a precious opportunity with three or four families
of Friends, the heads of which were all brethren and sisters of
each other, by blood, or marriage. It was a season wherein the
Lord was pleased to magnify his power, and cause every heart
to bow and acknowledge to its blessed and mollifying influence,
which prevailed over all to our mutual rejoicing.</p>

<p>The visit being over we took leave of our friends, and rode
that afternoon to Albany, and attended a pretty large meeting,
held that evening in their court-house. It was, I believe, to
many, a profitable edifying season. On sixth day morning
feeling my mind drawn to have a select opportunity, with the
few members of our society resident in this city, they were notified
thereof, and came together early in the forenoon. We had a
satisfactory season with them, in which I was favoured to clear
myself of a burden I felt on their account, in a plain tender manner,
comforting the sincere-hearted, and stirring up the careless
and lukewarm. After this we took our leave in brotherly affection,
with quiet and peaceful minds, and with an evidence of
having faithfully discharged our duty, which made our journeying
forward pleasant, as we passed on to Duanesburgh, where
we arrived that evening. On seventh day we rested. On first
day the 4th of 1st month, 1807, we attended the meeting there,
and notice being given of our attendance, it was a very large
meeting, wherein truth reigned. Many doctrinal truths were
opened to the people, and the gospel preached in the clear demonstration
of the spirit; to the Lord only wise, gracious and merciful,
be the praise, who is the blessed author thereof; nothing due
to man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>The next day we had a meeting in our way to Otego, near
a village called Charlestown, at the house of a man inclining to
Friends, in which I was enabled to communicate, in gospel
authority, to the tendering and contriting of many hearts.</p>

<p>We reached Otego on fourth day, a little before meeting time,
it being Friends’ usual meeting day, which, therefore, afforded
but little opportunity of notifying their neighbours; but some
hearing thereof, attended. It was a glorious meeting, which
richly paid us for all our toil in getting there, yea an hundred
fold; magnified for ever be the name of the Lord, who graciously
manifested his power for our help, comforting many hearts, and
causing the faithful to rejoice together, in the sweet incomes of
his love and life. On fifth day, we attended Friends’ meeting
held at Burlington in the middle of the week. The neighbouring
inhabitants having notice of our coming, generally attended,
and although the life did not appear to rise so high as in the
foregoing meeting, yet, for the most part, I believe, it was a
profitable edifying season. We rode to Deruyter on sixth day,
and on seventh day rested, and mended our carriage, which was
much injured and broken by our journey to this place. On
first day, we attended Friends’ meeting there, which was much
crowded, the house being but small. The Lord was with us,
and magnified his power, reaching and tendering many hearts;
the gospel was freely preached, and appeared to be freely received
by the auditory in general.</p>

<p>On second day, we had a meeting at a town called Woodstock,
at the eleventh hour, and one in the evening at Cazenovia.
There were no Friends living in either of these places, and the
people in general appeared dark and ignorant, yet, they were
attentive to what was communicated; and many of them appeared
thankful for the opportunities, and desired our longer continuance
among them; but we took our leave, and left them with our
minds clothed with peace. We then turned our faces homeward,
being desirous of getting back in time to attend the ensuing
quarterly meeting of Nine Partners, to be held in the forepart
of 2d month. We felt our minds drawn to return by Burlington,
and had meetings in our way there, at Hamilton, Brookfield,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[Pg 120]</span>
Bridgewater, and one in the evening between Bridgewater and
Burlington, held in a school-house, at a village in the township
of Brookfield. These were all favoured meetings, comfortable
and instructive, many hearts were reached and affected with the
power of truth, which was prevalently manifest for our help.</p>

<p>We were at Burlington on first day, and notice being generally
spread that we were there, it proved the largest meeting ever
held in that place; and through the Lord’s goodness and mercy
to us, it was made a season gratefully to be remembered, by, I
believe, the greater part of the meeting.</p>

<p>This being over, we had another meeting in the evening, in a
neighbouring town called Pittsfield, which was held in a large
school-house, there being no member of our society there; this
was likewise an edifying opportunity. The next day we proceeded
to Otego, and attended a meeting there at the eleventh
hour, appointed previously by our request. It was a large meeting,
and graciously favoured with the overshadowing wing of
divine kindness. On third day we had an appointed meeting in
the township of Heartwick.</p>

<p>From this place we returned to Duanesburgh, and attended
their monthly meeting held on sixth day. This meeting was composed
of the preparative meetings of Duanesburgh, Otego, Burlington,
and Deruyter. The latter meeting was near ninety miles
from the place where the monthly meeting was held at this time.
Friends are much scattered in this new country, by reason of
which, but few, in some meetings, have much opportunity of
attending their monthly meetings; this is a great loss to many
families, especially the children, many of whom are thus deprived
of the improving company of experienced Friends in
meetings for discipline or otherwise. I have often thought it a
very weighty matter for a Friend to move with a family of children
so far from meetings, and especially meetings for discipline,
which, I have often considered as schools of very profitable
instruction to well-minded youth. This is a new monthly
meeting, made up of Friends of but small experience, many of
them newly received members. The business of the meeting
was of course but weakly conducted. We laboured among them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[Pg 121]</span>
in the ability received, for their instruction and help, and there
appeared a readiness in some to receive, who, I trust, will become
useful members, as they abide in humility, and are faithful
to the measure of grace received. On seventh day we rode
to Oakhill, and on first day attended Friends’ meeting there; it
was a very full meeting, and proved satisfactory and instructive.</p>

<p>The four following days we were at meetings at Scott’s Patent,
Bern, Rensselaerville, one in a Friend’s house between the last
mentioned place and Coeman’s Patent, and one at Coeman’s
Patent. They were seasons of general satisfaction, especially the
last, which was a very large precious meeting, in which the truths
of the gospel were largely declared, in the demonstration of the
spirit. Many hearts were tendered and contrited, and the
Lord’s name praised and magnified, who is over all, worthy for
ever.</p>

<p>The sixth, we rode to Hudson, and passed most of the way
upon the ice, on the river, the weather having been, for some
days past, extremely cold. On seventh day evening we had an
appointed meeting at Lunenburgh, which lies on the west side of
the river Hudson, and opposite to that city. On first day we
attended Friends’ meeting at Hudson. Both these meetings were
held, I believe, to general satisfaction, and I trust, were profitable
and instructive to many who attended.</p>

<p>From hence we passed on to Nine Partners, and reached there
seasonably to meet with the committee who have the oversight
of the boarding-school, held there by the direction of our yearly
meeting, we being members of that committee. By the accounts
now rendered, the school appears in a prosperous state; but a
considerable difficulty attends procuring suitable tutors and caretakers
in the family. On third day, the select quarterly meeting
of this place was held, and on fourth day, that for discipline;
and although there was a degree of favour experienced,
yet, in general, it was a trying exercising season. This is a
large quarterly meeting; and many who attend are mere birthright
members, and having never known the baptizing power
of truth, to sanctify and prepare for right and useful membership,
are but as dead weights in our religious meetings; and some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[Pg 122]</span>
others, who have joined the society by convincement, for want of
faithfully attending to that which first convinced them, have lost
their first love, and suffered their minds too much to centre back
again into the world, and the love of it; and have thereby
become stumbling blocks in the way of others. These bring
much exercise and concern to the living, who are daily engaged
for Zion’s cause, and that truth may prosper and prevail in the
earth.</p>

<p>On fifth day, we had an appointed meeting at Pleasant Valley,
which was a comfortable instructive season; and another seasonable
opportunity in the evening at Poughkeepsie, composed mostly of
those not in membership with us. On sixth day, we were at West
Branch meeting, which was pretty full, wherein I had to go
down into deep baptism with the dead, being plunged into the
feeling of a state of great ignorance and unbelief; but as I
patiently sat under the burden, light sprang up, and life came
into dominion; and I was led, in a clear manner, to show the
ground from whence all this darkness and unbelief proceeded;
that it was from a want of due attention to, and right belief in,
the <i>inward manifestation of divine light</i>, which reveals itself
in the heart of man against sin and uncleanness; and at the
same time shows what is right, and justifies for right doing.
Therefore while men disregard this inward divine principle, of
grace and truth, and do not believe in it, as <i>essential</i> and <i>sufficient
to salvation</i>; they are in danger of becoming either Atheists,
or Deists&mdash;these are also in danger of becoming so blinded
as not to believe in that necessary and very essential doctrine of
perfection, as contained in that clear, rational, and positive injunction
of our dear Lord: “Be ye therefore perfect, even as your
Father which is in heaven is perfect.” And we cannot rationally
suppose they can ever be otherwise, while they continue in this
situation; as <i>nothing but this light</i> is sufficient to produce the
knowledge, on which this belief is founded. My mind was likewise
largely opened to communicate, how we all might, by faithful
attention and adherence to the aforesaid divine principle, <i>the
light within</i>, come to know and believe the certainty of those
excellent scripture doctrines; of the coming, life, righteous works,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[Pg 123]</span>
sufferings, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, our blessed
pattern: and that <i>it is by obedience to this inward light only</i>,
that we are prepared for an admittance into the heavenly kingdom.
It was a day of high favour, wherein the Lord’s arm was
made bare for our help, and the exaltation of his own glorious
and holy name, who is over all, blessed for ever.</p>

<p>This favoured opportunity being over, we rode that afternoon
to Samuel Dorland’s, and attended a meeting there appointed for
us that evening: and lodged with our worthy friend Enoch
Dorland. On seventh day we crossed the mountains called the
Highlands, in our way homeward, and got well to our friend
Abraham Underhill’s, at Croton River, that evening. The next
day, being the first of the week, we attended Friends’ meeting
there, and notice being given of our attendance, the meeting was
pretty full, and graciously attended with the divine presence, in
which strength was received to preach the gospel in the demonstration
of the spirit. It was a season thankfully to be remembered.</p>

<p>On second day, the 9th of 2d month, 1807, we rode to New-York,
where I was gladly received by my beloved daughter
Abigail, and her kind companion; we being mutually glad to
see each other. The next day we attended our meeting for
sufferings. I then rode home, that evening, and found my dear
wife and children well, to our mutual rejoicing; and we greeted
each other with thankful hearts.</p>

<p>I was from home in this journey about two months, and
attended forty-five particular meetings, nine monthly meetings,
one quarterly, and our meeting for sufferings twice; and travelled
upwards of seven hundred miles.</p>

<p>After returning from the aforesaid journey, I continued mostly
at and about home, for several months, attending our several
meetings as they came in course; and also at different times,
some appointed meetings among those not in profession with us,
in some adjacent neighbourhoods, to which I could go and return
in a few days. In all these seasons, I have thankfully to
acknowledge the Lord was near, and graciously manifested himself
to be a present helper in every needful time, furnishing with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[Pg 124]</span>
ability to labour in the work of the gospel, convincing, and comforting
many hearts; and to the solid relief and peace of my
own mind.</p>

<p>In the ensuing fall, having felt my mind renewedly engaged
in gospel love to visit a few of the meetings of Friends, in the
three lower quarterly meetings belonging to our yearly meeting;
and to have some meetings in divers places in those parts, among
those of other professions, I left home, with the unity of my
friends, the 31st of 10th month, 1807, and the seventh day of
the week, and went to New-York, having my beloved wife with
me; who proposed to be my companion in part of this journey.
We also took our two youngest daughters with us, in order to
place them in the boarding-school at Nine Partners. We
remained in New-York over first day, and attended Friends’
meetings there; that at Pearl-street in the morning, and at
Liberty-street in the afternoon. They were both, I trust, profitable
meetings, more especially the former; in which truth prevailed,
and came into dominion, solemnizing and comforting
many hearts; and was very strengthening to my mind, in the
prospect before me.</p>

<p>On second day we set out for Nine Partners, and reached
there seasonably to attend the quarterly meeting for discipline, the
ensuing fourth day; and the latter part of the week, we spent in
attending the quarterly meeting of Stanford. After this we
returned to the boarding-school and placed our daughters there;
and, as I was one of the committee, who have the superintendence
of the institution, I remained there about ten days. Then way
opening to proceed, I went as far as Hartford in Connecticut;
accompanied by two Friends who reside at Nine Partners. As
the weather was cold and unsettled, my wife remained at the
school, assisting the managers, until I returned. We had several
meetings in our way thither, and one as we returned; and
were at several in and about Hartford, mostly among those of
other professions. And the Lord, magnified for ever be his right
worthy name, was graciously pleased to be with us, and manifested
his power for our help; giving wisdom and strength,
tongue and utterance, and teaching to divide the word aright,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[Pg 125]</span>
to the states of the people; whereby his righteous cause was exalted
in many minds, and his glorious holy truth raised into
dominion over all, in divers of those favoured opportunities; to
the praise of his grace, “who is over all, God blessed for ever.”</p>

<p>On my return to the school, I again spent some days with the
family, assisting them in the management thereof; and then, my
wife and myself took leave of our children and friends, in much
mutual affection; and turned our faces homeward. We attended
Oswego monthly meeting in our way, on fourth day, the 16th
of 12th month; and the next day had an appointed meeting at
Apoquague. On sixth day we rode through the mountains to
Peekskill, and lodged with our kind friend Nathaniel Brown.
We attended their meeting on first day, and on second day, we
had an appointed meeting at a place called Crompond; which
was held in a meeting-house belonging to the Presbyterians, by
their proposal. On fourth day we were at Amawalk, on fifth
day at Shapaqua, and on sixth day we had an appointed
meeting at Mount Pleasant; this was likewise held in a place
of worship belonging to the Presbyterians. We rode to New-York
on seventh day, and on first day attended Friends’ meeting
there. The third day following we left the city on our way
home, but a storm came on soon after we left, and increased to
that degree, that when we came to the ferry at Hurlgate, where
we intended to cross, we found it impassable. We then turned
our course and rode to our friend Joseph Byrd’s at Harlem, and
lodged. I felt my mind drawn towards having a meeting at
that place when passing down to the city, but admitting some
doubts to arise, as to the clearness of the prospect, I omitted it;
but now, way opening with more clearness, we had one appointed
the next day, which proved a favoured season. After this we
crossed the ferry that afternoon, and rode to Flushing, and the
next day being the fifth of the week, and 31st of 12th month,
we attended Friends’ meeting there; and then rode home that
afternoon, and were gladly received by our friends. My spirit was
made humbly joyful, in believing that the Lord Almighty had
graciously condescended to be with us, to lead us in the way,
manifesting his loving kindness and mercy, in a greater or lesser<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[Pg 126]</span>
degree, in all those opportunities, convicting, convincing, edifying
and comforting many hearts; and encouraging the honest
travellers Zion-ward. May his right worthy name be praised
and exalted above all for ever.</p>

<p>As our return home at this time was hastened by the inclemency
of the season, we being out with a carriage, and likely to be prevented
from travelling by the snow, my mind was not relieved
of the prospect before me. Therefore, after remaining at and
about home a few weeks, I again set out, with the unity of my
friends, in order to finish what was left behind of my former
concern. Charles Willets a friend and neighbour accompanied me.
We set out the 24th of 1st month, 1808, and attended the three
quarterly meetings of Purchase, Nine Partners, and Stanford, as
they came in course: and likewise five particular meetings in the
intermediate space, between Purchase and Nine Partners. We
were from home at this time about five weeks; and attended three
quarterly meetings, one monthly, and twenty-three particular meetings.
And I have abundant cause, with humble gratitude, to
admire the adorable loving kindness, and condescending goodness,
of a gracious God to me a poor creature; in enabling me to surrender
all up to his heavenly disposal, to be any thing or nothing, as he
would have me to be; leading me from place to place, as a weaned
child, by the guiding of his power, and the influence of his precious
love: and teaching me, not only how to suffer want, but likewise,
how to abound; and in every situation and dispensation which
he is pleased to lead into, to be therewith content. Under a renewed
sense whereof, my spirit is led to acknowledge, that “great
and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and
true are thy ways, thou King of saints.” Even so. Amen.</p>

<p>In the spring of the year 1808, our yearly meeting, from an
exercise in observing the many deficiencies, brought up in the
reports from the several quarterly meetings, issued an epistle, or
minute of advice and caution, to its subordinate meetings. And
in order to strengthen and enforce the same, and to make it the
more effectual to promote a reformation, appointed a committee
to attend therewith. And I, being one appointed with divers
other brethren and sisters, willingly engaged therein; as a con<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[Pg 127]</span>cern,
of a similar nature, had for some time previous thereto
attended my mind.</p>

<p>Accordingly, at the close of the yearly meeting, we agreed to
enter upon the service at the succeeding quarterly meeting at
Nine Partners; and to attend in succession the quarterly meetings
of Stanford and Easton, as they came in course. Two
men, and three women Friends, joined me in this northern tour;
and several others of the committee attended at the quarterly
meetings. After those meetings, we proceeded to attend with the
minute, all the monthly meetings constituting them; except the
three distant ones, of Adolphustown in Upper Canada, and Farmington
and Scipio, in the western part of the state of New-York:
also a considerable number of the preparative meetings,
as way opened therefor. Although great and many were the
apparent deviations and departures of many of our members, in
the varied classes of society, from that ancient simplicity and
integrity, which marked the conduct of our worthy predecessors,
in the dawn of this latter gospel day; and by this declension,
those noble testimonies given us to bear, for the prince of peace,
and the promotion of the cause of truth and righteousness in the
earth, were by many, but weakly supported; and by others,
almost wholly neglected; grieving and wounding the hearts of
the faithful, and reproaching our Christian profession: nevertheless,
we had abundant cause gratefully to acknowledge the condescending
goodness and mercy of the great Head of the Church,
in uniting us together in the work, and in owning the concern
from place to place; giving full evidence thereto in a general
manner, by the manifestations of his love and power; and
thereby enabling and qualifying his weak and unworthy though
devoted servants, who were very sensible they had no might nor
ability of their own, to perform the service they were engaged in, to
his honour, or the promotion of his righteous cause; and to communicate
counsel and encouragement, reproof and caution, as
occasion required, and opportunity offered; by which the faithful
were strengthened, and made at times to rejoice together, the
hearts of Friends being in a very general manner, opened cordially
to receive us and the concern, with much unanimity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>We had many precious opportunities as we passed along, in
public meetings, (many of which were much crowded, by those
coming in who were not in membership with us,) and also in meetings
for discipline; truth being often raised powerfully into dominion
over all. So that in many of those favoured seasons, we were
strengthened to set up our Ebenezer, and to say, in the heart-felt
language of filial and grateful acknowledgments, “hitherto hath
the Lord helped us.” And, I believe, it was a season of renewed
powerful visitation, and manifestation of the Lord’s mercy to
many; not only to the members of our society, but also, to others
that are without, who were favoured with the privilege of attending
the public meetings.</p>

<p>After getting through this part of the service, which took us
between nine and ten weeks, in which time we travelled upwards
of one thousand miles, and attended three quarterly meetings,
seventeen monthly meetings, sixteen preparative meetings, and
forty public meetings for worship, including those that preceded
the monthly and preparative meetings, we returned home, and
remained until the time of the next quarterly meetings’ coming
on when I again joined some of the committee, and attended
the quarterly meetings of Westbury and Purchase, and all the
monthly meetings constituting them; except Purchase monthly
meeting. And I may say with gratitude of heart, that the same
divine power that attended in the foregoing part of the visit, was
again manifested for our help, in going through, and finishing
the service, to the humble admiration and solid peace of my
own mind, and the praise of his own right worthy name, “who
is over all, God blessed for ever.” How great and wonderful
is his goodness and loving kindness to the children of men; his
mercies are present every moment; and as saith the prophet,
“they are new every morning:” therefore saith my soul let all
praise and exalt him above all, for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>

<p>In the latter part of the winter, and spring of the year 1809,
with the concurrence of our monthly meeting, I made a pretty
general visit to the meetings of Friends, within the quarterly
meeting of Purchase; and attended some meetings belonging to
Nine Partners quarterly meeting; and also appointed a consi<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[Pg 129]</span>derable
number among others, in the adjacent parts. I found
great openness generally among the people, to hear the truths of
the gospel; and a number, I believe, received them with sincerity
of heart; and I was made glad in believing, that the Lord was
graciously near, and accompanied the word preached, with his
heart-tendering power, comforting and refreshing the broken
hearted, reviving the spirit of the contrite ones, and stopping the
mouths of gainsayers. For these favours my soul was often
bowed, in deep humility and contrition of spirit, accompanied
with grateful acknowledgments and thanksgiving, for his wonderful
works to the children of men.</p>

<p>The year 1810, I spent mostly at home, except performing
a visit to some of the neighbouring inhabitants, not in membership
with us. I was from home in this service a few weeks in
the spring; and in the summer I performed a visit to the half
year’s meeting at Canada, by appointment from our yearly
meeting.</p>

<p>I passed the year 1811 at and near home, in attending our
own and some adjacent meetings; also some meetings in divers
neighbourhoods among other societies. I had frequent cause to
rejoice in a living hope, that truth was gradually rising, and the
true light shining more and more in the hearts of the people;
and that in the Lord’s time, it would be exalted and become a
great mountain, and fill the whole earth.</p>

<p>In the winter and spring of the year 1812, with the concurrence
of my friends, I passed about four weeks in visiting the
neighbouring inhabitants, not of our society. I had twenty-eight
meetings, all held in private houses; many of them were very
large and crowded, and the Lord was graciously near, comforting
and refreshing the sincere-hearted, and opening counsel to those
who wanted information, and sealing his testimony on the minds
of the people, to the exaltation of his own righteous cause, and
to the glory of his excellent name, “who is over all, God blessed
for ever.”</p>

<p>In the forepart of the winter of 1813, feeling a renewed concern
toward the neighbouring inhabitants of our island, and New-York,
not in profession with us; many of whom are as sheep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[Pg 130]</span>
without a shepherd, and appeared to be under exercise and concern,
to be rightly instructed in the way of peace and salvation, in
gospel love, and with the unity of my friends, I paid them a visit.
I had upwards of twenty meetings in the different parts, much
to my own satisfaction, and, I trust, to the edification and comfort
of many who attended. The Lord, our gracious helper, was
near, and covered the assemblies with his solemnizing presence
and power; and instructed to divide the word to the several
states, in the demonstration of the spirit. For these unmerited
favours, I was made at seasons to rejoice, and in deep humiliation
and thankfulness of heart, to joy in the God of my salvation,
who does wondrous things in mercy, for the children of men, in
order to hide pride from man, and turn him from his unrighteous
purposes, and save his soul from the pit, that so he may know,
and seek after God.</p>

<p>Before I had got fully through this little tour of duty, a further
prospect opened, toward a visit to Friends and others in the
compass of Purchase quarterly meeting, and some of the neighbouring
parts of the state of Connecticut, where none of our
society reside: and under the impression of duty I laid the concern
before our monthly meeting held in 1st month, 1813, and
received its concurrence, in a short minute for that purpose. I
left home the 6th of 2d month following, my kind friend Gideon
Seaman, an Elder, and member of Westbury monthly meeting,
accompanied me in this visit.</p>

<p>We passed to New-York on our way, and on first day attended
the forenoon meeting at Pearl-street, and the afternoon meeting
at Liberty-street; and had an appointed meeting on second day
evening in the northeast part of the town, in a large room in a
public house. It was a favoured season, and largely attended;
many more came than the room could contain. The two foregoing
meetings were also favoured strengthening opportunities,
affording encouragement in my first setting out in the weighty
and solemn service before me, which I always esteem that of
appointing meetings to be, more especially those among strangers;
many of whom know but little of us, or of the manner in which
we hold our meetings, and therefore are apt to get restless, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[Pg 131]</span>
sometimes much disquieted at our sitting so long in silence, as we
often have to do; that it requires, in Friends, at such seasons, a
very deep indwelling with the seed of life, to prevent being jostled,
or interrupted in our inward travail and waiting, for the pure
motion of life; lest, by their eagerness to hear words, Friends on
those occasions, might be led to venture on too small an intimation
and without sufficiently turning the fleece again and again,
and to feel clearly, that, “wo is unto me, if I preach not the
gospel.” For want of this care, there is danger sometimes of our
running in vain, and so not profit the people at all, nor procure
peace to our own minds.</p>

<p>I was from home in this journey about four weeks, and rode
upwards of three hundred miles; and attended twenty-five meetings,
and our meeting for sufferings twice. Twelve of these
meetings were among people not of our society; and where there
are no meetings of Friends. Among these I found great openness
to receive us, and our testimony; many expressed their satisfaction
with the opportunities, and manifested a desire in most
places, that we would stay longer with them, and have more
meetings. Indeed truth was so prevalent in those meetings, as
not only to silence, at least for the present, all opposition, but in
many of them to reign triumphantly over all; whereby many
minds were comforted and instructed, and the power of truth
exalted; and our hearts made glad in believing, that the Shepherd
of Israel is still availingly stretching forth the crook of his
love, and will gather many from the highways and hedges;
whom, as they attend to his call, and abide faithful to the end, he
will clothe with the wedding garment, and admit into the marriage
chamber of the Lamb; while many of those, who have been
long and often invited, but are nevertheless making excuses, in
order to attend to their farms, their merchandize, their oxen, &amp;c.,
will not be able to enter.</p>

<p class="chap-head">Engagements at and about home, 1813.&mdash;Visit to Friends in the middle and
southern states, 1813.</p>


<p>Sixth day, 26th of 3d month, 1813. My worldly concerns
engrossed much of my time to-day. How true is that saying,
“No man can serve two masters.” O, how hard a master the
world is; and from whose servitude I often feel strong desires to
be fully redeemed; so that all my time may be more fully dedicated
to the service of my heavenly master, whom, I often feel, I sincerely
love.</p>

<p>Seventh day. Part of this day I spent in repairing a vehicle,
in which I have travelled several thousand miles, in my religious
engagements. Most of the evening was occupied in reading the
excellent doctrine of our Lord relative to the Comforter, and the
union and communion between himself and his faithful followers,
as recorded by John the Evangelist. If it is sweet and pleasant
to read, how much more precious and excellent is it to know
and witness it in our own experience.</p>

<p>First day. Our meeting this day passed in silent labour.
The cloud rested on the tabernacle: and, although it was a day
of much rain outwardly, yet very little of the dew of Hermon
appeared to distil among us. Nevertheless, a comfortable calm
was witnessed towards the close; which we must render to the
account of unmerited mercy and love.</p>

<p>Second day. Most of this day was occupied in a visit to a
sick friend, who appeared comforted therewith. Spent part of
the evening in reading part of Paul’s Epistle to the Romans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>Third day. I was busied most of this day in my common
vocations. Spent the evening principally in reading Paul.
Found considerable satisfaction in his first epistle to the Corinthians;
in which he shows the danger of some in setting too high
a value on those who were instrumental in bringing them to the
knowledge of the truth, without looking through and beyond the
instrument, to the great first cause and Author of every blessing,
to whom all the praise and honour are due.</p>

<p>Fifth day, 1st of 4th month. At our meeting to-day found it,
as usual, a very close steady exercise to keep the mind centered
where it ought to be. What a multitude of intruding thoughts
imperceptibly, as it were, steal into the mind, and turn it from its
proper object, whenever it relaxes its vigilance in watching against
them. Felt a little strength, just at the close, to remind Friends
of the necessity of a steady perseverance, by a recapitulation of
the parable of the unjust judge, showing how men ought always
to pray, and not to faint.</p>

<p>Sixth day. Nothing material occurred, but a fear lest the
cares of the world should engross too much of my time.</p>

<p>Seventh day. Had an agreeable visit from two ancient friends,
whom I have long loved. The rest of the day I employed in
manual labour, mostly in gardening.</p>

<p>First day. Felt my mind drawn to attend to-day a meeting,
a few miles from home, held, for the present, by indulgence of
Friends. I was led forth in a line of encouragement and caution
to a seeking travailing remnant; and in warning to the indolent
and self-righteous, endeavouring to show them the danger of
resting in such a polluted state; many hearts were contrited, and
a comfortable solemnity clothed the meeting, for which we were
made thankful to the gracious Author of all our blessings.</p>

<p>Second day. This day spent in manual labour, a less proportion
of which would suffice for me, if every other man was
disposed to do his part: but the poor and the indolent must and
will be helped.</p>

<p>Third and fourth days. Mostly occupied in my temporal
concerns, with attendant poverty of spirit, and a longing after
spiritual food, free from condemnation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended our preparative meeting, at which our
queries were read, and answers prepared to be sent to the yearly
meeting; but too much, I fear, in a formal way, and may, if
not well guarded against, become a snare to us, as the brazen
serpent was to Israel.</p>

<p>Sixth day. I can say little more than that I wearied myself
with hard labour in assisting my workmen to build stone fences.
In the evening read Paul’s Epistle to the Galatians, in which I
think he has fully shown the final end and abolishment of all
outward ordinances and observations in matters of religion.</p>

<p>Seventh day. This day I spent mostly in manual labour.
Some little interruption of mind by the improper conduct of one
of my labourers. How hard a thing it is to find, in such persons,
honesty, industry, and a suitable deportment, united in the same
individual; and yet it is no more than ought to be in every man,
and it is always their duty and interest to be so.</p>

<p>First day. At our meeting to-day the fire seemed very low
on the altar. Dulness, and a spirit of heaviness were too predominant
with many; occasioned, no doubt, by a too near attachment
to the world, and the things of it, with some, and by too
much lightness and vanity with others. Alas, how much good
seed is lost by the wayside, in stony places, and on thorny
ground. Just at the close, I was engaged to call the attention
of the people to the necessity of having always a proper point, or
object to aim at, a right centre to all their hopes and desires; and
that God was the only proper object for man to set his heart
upon, as the doing his will is the whole sum and substance of
all true religion and worship.</p>

<p>Second, third and fourth days. Spent in usual labour, with
a peaceful mind.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended our monthly meeting to-day at which
I received a certificate of their unity and concurrence with a
prospect, which I had previously opened to them, of performing
a religious visit to Friends and others, in some parts of the
yearly meetings of Pennsylvania and Baltimore, and the adjacent
parts of Virginia. How humbling it is to the natural man
to be called to the performance of those duties, for which he feels<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[Pg 135]</span>
himself destitute of every right means and capacity: he is therefore
brought under the necessity of trusting in, and depending
upon, that invisible arm of power, which is beyond the reach of
all mortals to command or controul.</p>

<p>Sixth day. Felt much poverty of spirit at our preparative
meeting of Ministers and Elders. How necessary it is for such
as fill those stations in society, to dig faithfully with their staves,
like the princes and nobles of Israel formerly, by the direction of
the lawgiver, saying, “spring up, O well, sing ye unto it;” that
so they may be favoured both with the upper and the nether
spring: for how otherwise can they be good waymarks and ensamples
to the flock, over whom the Holy Ghost has made all
the rightly qualified of this description overseers, and who will
have to give an account of the flock under their charge.</p>

<p>Seventh day. Spent in my usual vocation as a farmer or
husbandman, in which I need incessantly to watch against the
intrusions of worldly cares.</p>

<p>First day. Had close exercise, through the greatest part of
our meeting to-day in opposing a dull drowsy spirit, which,
through unmerited mercy and help, I vanquished towards the
close: soon after which, I was unexpectedly called upon to
sound an alarm to the youth, and to show them the danger of
suffering the intruding vanities and follies of the world to steal
away their affections from their supreme good, and blessed Author
of their being and well-being, in and on whom they ought to fix
their only best hope and trust, who is the true and only source of
all felicity and blessedness in time and in eternity.</p>

<p>Second day. My temporal concerns necessarily engaged my
attention to-day; in pursuing of which, nothing transpired to
interrupt or turn the mind from its proper centre.</p>

<p>The four following days were principally occupied in attending
our quarterly meeting, held, at this time, in New-York. I think
it was, on the whole, a favoured season. The canopy of the
heavenly Father’s care was sensibly felt to overshadow the meeting
in its several sittings. I spread before the meeting for discipline
my prospect of a religious visit to Friends and others in
some of the southern states, with the certificate of concurrence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[Pg 136]</span>
from our last monthly meeting. The meeting fully united
therewith, and I was left at liberty to pursue the journey as way
should open therefor. What deep obligations devolve upon us,
when thus liberated by our friends, and separated to travel in
the service of the gospel, that we are careful, in no case, to make
the gospel chargeable to any, nor abuse our power in it; but
that, in deep humility and reverential fear, we wait for the putting
forth of the Shepherd of Israel, and know him to go before:
then will the Lord’s cause prosper in our hands, and his people
be edified and instructed, and we comforted in our labours of
love, to the glory and praise of his right excellent name, who is
over all, God blessed for ever.</p>

<p>Seventh day. Was busied to-day in my farming business,
endeavouring to get all my temporal concerns properly arranged,
expecting soon to proceed on the visit already mentioned; as I
consider it my especial duty, as much as in me lies, to leave all
in a state of order and quiet, so that nothing may remain on the
mind that would tend to interrupt or disturb it, while travelling
in this weighty service, nor that any should have cause to complain,
whom I leave behind.</p>

<p>First day. Having felt my mind inclined to see Friends in
their meeting at Bethpage before I left home, I went there to
day, accompanied by my wife, our two youngest daughters, and
a sober young woman of our neighbourhood. Their company
was pleasant, and, after a time of deep inward travail and suffering,
I trust the season was profitable and edifying to a number
present. How often are the living baptized for the dead, in order
for their arising; for if the dead are not raised, preaching is vain.</p>

<p>Second and third days. Spent in preparing my business,
looking for the time of setting out on my intended journey.
May I be ready and willing when the time comes, without murmuring
or complaining; for, as I trust and believe a dispensation
of the gospel is committed to me, wo is unto me if I preach
not the gospel.</p>

<p>Fourth day. Alas, how the cares of the world intrude on the
mind and engross its attention, if they are not carefully watched
against with fervent prayer!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended our usual meeting. Found it necessary
to engage against a dull heavy spirit, that seemed very prevalent
in the meeting: but, as I maintained the struggle, I was favoured
with a good degree of victory towards the close, when a ray of
light broke forth, attended with peace and quietude of mind, an
ample reward for all my toil.</p>

<p>Sixth day. I endeavoured to spend this day as I ought to do.
Met with some interruption from a careless neighbour, by the
trespass of his unruly cattle. How much more comfort and
satisfaction would neighbourhoods enjoy, if all honestly endeavoured
to walk uprightly, agreeably to that excellent rule left us
by Jesus Christ: “all things whatsoever ye would that men
should do to you, do ye even so to them; for this is the law
and the prophets.”</p>

<p>Seventh day, 1st of 5th month. Still pressing after a more
full release from the world and its cares, endeavouring to redeem
the time, because the days are still evil, or attended in many
respects, with much evil. The alarm of war is heard in the
land, and much contention is among the people. Flee, O my
soul, to thy rock, the name of the Lord; for, in it is safety, and
a sure refuge from all the storms and tempests, that assail poor
mortals in passing through this vale of tears, and state of trial
and probation.</p>

<p>First day. Had to suffer through the meeting to-day. Alas,
how oft have the poor ministers to be baptized for, and with, the
dead!</p>

<p>Second day. Still pressing after a release from my worldly
cares; as the time is near at hand, when I shall proceed on my
proposed journey to the south and west on my good Master’s
business, I hope, in the way he is pleased to lead.</p>

<p>Third day. Felt much poverty of spirit to-day, although
nothing particular has occurred either on the right hand or the
left; therefore I feel, in a good degree, a peaceful mind which is
worthy of thanksgiving.</p>

<p>Fourth day. Still pressing after a full settlement of my temporal
concerns that I may be in a state of readiness to pursue my
journey, as soon as the way opens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[Pg 138]</span></p>

<p>Fifth day. Was favoured, towards the close of our meeting
to-day, to discharge another debt of love and care to my friends,
as it was likely to be the last opportunity I should have with
them before I proceeded on my intended journey; and, through
the prevalence of gospel love, it was made a tendering baptizing
season to some, and we parted under a degree of the uniting
influence of it.</p>

<p>Sixth day. Still aiming at the same mark of readiness and
preparation for my journey, expecting to leave home to-morrow,
and proceed therein, if the cloud is removed from the tabernacle,
and the light should lead the way.</p>

<p>Seventh day, 8th of 5th month, 1813. I commenced the
journey on this day, after a precious solemn season with my
family, in which I was favoured, in fervent supplication, to
recommend them to the divine protection and preserving care
of the Shepherd of Israel. Under a thankful sense of his loving
kindness we took leave of each other in much affectionate sympathy
and brokenness of spirit, I rode to New-York with a peaceful
and quiet mind. My kinsman Isaac Hicks, of Westbury,
kindly accompanied me in this journey.</p>

<p>First day. Attended Friends’ meetings there, in the morning
at Pearl-street, and in the afternoon at Liberty-street. They
were both exercising seasons, and I hope profitable to some, as
in all right exercise we are encouraged to believe there is profit.
After these opportunities, and a favoured season in a family of
Friends, the heads of which were Elders, I felt a pretty full
release from the city at present.</p>

<p>Second day. Proceeded on our journey to Newark, where
we attended a meeting appointed for us at the third hour.
It was on the whole, I think, a favoured season; many truths
of the gospel were opened to the people, and appeared to have
a good degree of entrance to the minds of some present; although
others appeared to be too much fettered by the prejudice
of education to be profited by them. The meeting closed in
solemn quiet; and I left them with a peaceful mind. We then
rode to Rahway and lodged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>Third day. This afternoon at the third hour we attended a
meeting previously appointed at Elizabethtown. Many of the
most respectable inhabitants attended, among whom were the
governour of the state of New-Jersey and his wife; and a very
considerable number of young people. The Lord, who is a
never-failing helper to those that trust in him, was near, furnishing
with ability to preach the gospel of life and salvation to the
people, in the clear demonstration of the spirit; and with a power
attending, that produced great brokenness of heart and contrition
of spirit among them; and the power of his divine love was felt
to spread over the meeting as a precious canopy. We parted
with them in humiliation and deep thankfulness of heart, rejoicing
that his loving kindness was still extended to his backsliding
and offending creature man.</p>

<p>Fourth and fifth days. We attended Friends’ meetings at
Plainfield and Rahway.</p>

<p>Sixth day. We had a favoured meeting at New Brunswick
among the inhabitants of the town. Many truths of the gospel
were opened to their consideration; and a comfortable solemnity
was witnessed to spread over the meeting.</p>

<p>Seventh day. We rode to Upper Freehold, intending to be at
Friends’ meeting at East Branch in that township on first day.
We lodged at the house of our friend George Frost, where I
had lodged before in my way through these parts, about twelve
years prior to this time. We met a very kind reception from our
said friend and his family; and it seemed like a fresh renewal
of friendship and affection between us. How consoling it is for
the weary traveller to meet with kind friends! it is as a brook by
the way in a time of drought.</p>

<p>First day. We attended East Branch meeting as proposed.
The forepart was exercising, for want of a lively travail among
the members; too many of whom seemed in a dead, lifeless
state, as to a right religious concern. This makes hard labour
for the living exercised members, and is very trying to those who
visit them in the service of truth; yet as we kept up the travail
for truth’s arising, and patiently abode under suffering, a degree
of light broke forth, and led to a seasonable, and I trust, instruc<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[Pg 140]</span>tive
communication; in which I found relief and peace in the
labour, which I consider a great favour.</p>

<p>Second day. Were at Upper Freehold meeting. It was a
season of deep suffering in the forepart, in which my spirit was
deeply baptized with, and for the dead; but as I patiently submitted
to the crucifying operation of the present dispensation, a
degree of light sprang up, and in it I was led to view the declaration
of the apostle Paul, that “death reigned from Adam to
Moses,” and to show to the people, that all the unregenerate
were under the influence and power of the same death. For in
Adam, that is, in the transgressing state, all die. And that it is
only by and through our attention being turned to the inward
divine law, which the apostle calls, “the law of the spirit of life
in Christ Jesus,” and our yielding full obedience thereunto, that
we can be set free and delivered from this law of sin and death,
which was typified by Israel’s deliverance, from the bondage of
Pharaoh, by a full and implicit obedience to the outward commands
of God, through his servant Moses. As I attended carefully
to the opening, truth rose into victory, and administered
cause of thanksgiving, under a grateful sense of the continued
mercy and loving kindness of our gracious Creator to his backsliding
creature man.</p>

<p>The three following days we attended meetings at Crosswicks,
alias Chesterfield, Upper Springfield, and a meeting called the
Mount. These were all favoured meetings, wherein the Lord’s
presence and power were manifested, tendering and contriting
many hearts, giving tongue and utterance; and through which
the gospel was preached in the demonstration of the spirit, and
with a power attending, which carried sharp reproof to the disobedient
and unfaithful, strength to the weak and feeble minded,
confirmation and encouragement to the honest-hearted, humble
traveller; and mutually rejoicing the sincere-hearted. For all
these favours my spirit was made humbly thankful to the Shepherd
of Israel, to whom all the glory and praise is due, for his
mercy endureth for ever.</p>

<p>Sixth day. Attended Friends’ meeting at Old Springfield. It
was a precious baptizing season, the Lord’s presence and power<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[Pg 141]</span>
were felt to spread over the meeting, affecting and contriting
many present; and comforting and encouraging the honest
travellers Zion-ward. The meeting closed under a thankful
sense of divine favour, with prayer and praise.</p>

<p>Seventh day. We were at Mansfield. On first day were at
Bordentown in the morning, and at Lower Mansfield in the
afternoon. These meetings were well attended and very solemn.
The two last, Friends informed me were unusually large. Oh
how good is the Lord, and greatly to be praised for his marvellous
works, and his never failing loving kindness to the children
of men.</p>

<p>Second day. We were at Burlington. In this meeting my
mind was opened largely to set forth the nature and design of
the gospel dispensation; and to show, that as none had ever
been perfect in it, but the man Jesus Christ, we had not a right,
as his professed followers, to take the example of any but his
own, for our real perfect rule of life. For all who have gone
before us have in a greater or less degree, through the undue
force and prejudice of education, fallen short of the perfect rule
left us in his example and precepts.</p>

<p>I also showed them that the Christian professors in the varied
ages of the Church had very much marred and obstructed the
work of reformation, by suffering themselves to be too closely
attached to their several particular leaders; and have therefore
justly thrown themselves open to the censure of the apostle;
wherein he blames some of the primitive Christians for setting
themselves one against another, by the partiality each had for
the minister, by whom he had been brought over to the Christian
faith, one crying, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of
Cephas, and some more wise, I of Christ; to whose example all
ought to have looked, and not turned their attention so much to
the instruments, by whom they were brought to believe in him.
Although many of our worthy predecessors according to their
measure of light endeavoured faithfully to do the work of their
day, yet few, if any of them, had been so entirely emancipated
from the undue force of education, as to see clearly through the
cloud of prejudice produced thereby; and therefore were in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[Pg 142]</span>
practice of divers things, not consistent with that perfect justice
which the example and precepts of our Lord call for, and which
are in full unison with the perfect righteousness of the gospel.
The word was preached in a large searching testimony, I trust
through divine assistance, in the demonstration of the spirit, to
the comfort and encouragement of the sincere in heart, and the
peace of my own mind.</p>

<p>Third day. Were at Rancocas. The meeting was solemn, and
the Lord’s presence was felt to preside, humbling many minds;
and many truths of the gospel were in an instructive manner
spread before the people.</p>

<p>Fourth and fifth days. We attended meetings at Mount
Holly, Upper Evesham, and were at Easton on fifth day afternoon;
these were all favoured meetings. In the two former,
my mind was largely opened in two doctrinal testimonies, wherein
the design and end of all the shadows of the law were clearly
opened; and the necessity of their entire abolishment at the
death and resurrection of Christ clearly shown. I also opened to
them, that, by the primitive Christians retaining many of the
shadows of the law, the apostacy broke in upon the Church, and
that by the retention of some of the same shadows, the reformation
had been, and is still greatly retarded: and will never
advance on its right foundation, until those shadows are all discarded
and done away. My mind was deeply humbled, under
a sense of the Lord’s mercy.</p>

<p>The three following days we were at Lower Evesham, Cropwell,
Chester, Westfield, Haddonfield, and at Newtown, attending
two meetings each day. After the latter meeting, on first day
evening, we crossed the river Delaware to Philadelphia. In those
meetings my mind was deeply humbled, under a grateful sense
of the Lord’s continued mercy to an unworthy people; rendered
so by the continued disobedience and revolting of great numbers,
who go under our name, not only among the youth, but with
many of riper age, whose experience and daily observation we
might reasonably suppose, had they endeavoured to improve by
it, would, ere now, have taught them better. But how true is
that saying of the great Master: “If therefore the light that is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[Pg 143]</span>
in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness.” This has
fallen to the lot of those, by turning their backs upon the true
light, and adhering to their own carnal reasonings and fleshly
consultations, whereby they have been left like Balaam, through
his covetousness, to justify themselves in many things, which the
true light in them, had they been obedient to its manifestations,
would not have approved. Therefore these are left as a reward
of their disobedience to believe a lie to their own confusion.</p>

<p>My mind was largely opened in these meetings, not only to
commemorate the Lord’s gracious dealings with the children of
men; but likewise to set forth and open to the several auditories
the subtle workings and varied transformations of that diabolical
spirit, which lies in wait to deceive and counteract the gracious
designs of heaven among the children of men. And under a
renewed sense of the Lord’s continued mercy, my spirit was led
to exclaim, as did one formerly: “Great and marvellous are thy
works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are all thy ways,
thou King of saints.”</p>

<p>The following week we spent in the city, except on seventh
day we rode out and attended two meetings; one in the morning
at Frankford, and the other at Germantown, at five in the afternoon.
These were both favoured seasons. We then returned
in the evening to Philadelphia; and the next day being the first
of the week, and the 6th of 6th month, were at Friends’ meeting
at Arch-street in the morning, and at the North meeting in the
afternoon. Some previous notice having been given of my intention
of attending them, they were unusually large; and many
had to go away for want of room. It was supposed there were
three thousand people at the beginning of the meeting, and
toward the close many more than the rooms could contain.
Through the marvellous condescension and loving kindness of
our gracious God, my mind was strengthened and qualified to
preach the gospel of peace and salvation to the people, in the
demonstration of the spirit, and with a power attending, that
brought home the doctrine, to the humbling conviction of many
minds. In the first I was engaged to bear testimony to the
excellency of a life of strict and impartial justice and righteous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[Pg 144]</span>ness,
as the only right foundation of every real religious and
moral virtue; and without which no true virtue could possibly
exist. The communication comprehended much salutary caution,
reproof and encouragement, suited to the varied states present;
under a sense of which my mind was deeply humbled, and
had gratefully to acknowledge, “this is the Lord’s doings, and
marvellous in mine eyes.” The latter was likewise a favoured season,
wherein many truths of the gospel were opened to the people,
tending to lead their minds off from all dependence on traditional
religion and worship; and to gather them home to the eternal
substance in themselves, Christ, the hope of glory and light of
the world; by the influence of whose light and spirit, we only
can be enabled to obtain victory over the world and its spirit,
and become qualified to worship the Father in spirit and in
truth.</p>

<p>The 7th we left Philadelphia. In the course of this week
and the next first day, we attended eleven meetings in the following
order, previous notice having gone forward. On second day
at Darby; third day at Haverford in the morning, and at Merion
at the fifth hour in the afternoon; fourth day at the Valley;
fifth day at Radnor, which was their monthly meeting; sixth
day at Newtown in the morning, and at Springfield in the afternoon;
seventh day at Middletown in the morning, and at Providence
in the afternoon; first day at Chester in the morning, and
at Chichester in the afternoon. And although I was taken
very unwell on third day afternoon, before the third meeting as
above arranged, and continued so through the week, and until
the last meeting; insomuch that for several days I could take
scarcely any nourishment, my stomach loathing all food; yet to
my humbling admiration, I was strengthened to go through the
service of these meetings, which in each was arduous and extensive.
At the close of some of them my strength was so exhausted,
being wet from head to foot with extreme sweating, that it
seemed to me after divers of those exercising seasons, almost
impossible for me to reach the next; but that which is impossible
to man, we often find easy to the great Helper of his people. As
my care was wholly cast upon Him, he graciously accompanied,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[Pg 145]</span>
by his holy presence, from meeting to meeting. When I first
sat down in many of those meetings, the force of my complaint
seemed to absorb all my strength both of body and mind; yet as
I endeavoured to centre in quiet, I seldom sat long before the
light sprang up, and dispelled all the darkness, and opened doctrine
new and old; and strengthened to communicate in a way
of clear demonstration. The honest-hearted were strengthened
and instructed, and conviction and reproof brought home to the
delinquent, and a visitation of entreaty and love extended to the
beloved young people, whose minds were not yet hardened in
vice; showing them, what great and everlasting benefits and
blessings would redound to them, by an early dedication of their
hearts to the Lord. My mind at the close of these large solemn
meetings, (for many were very large, more than the houses could
contain,) was generally centered in perfect peace, wherein I was
led to contemplate the Lord’s marvellous loving kindness to me a
poor unworthy creature, and his wonderful works in mercy to
the children of men; waiting in long forbearance for their return,
and continuing his call to them by his spirit, through his servants
and messengers, rising up early and sending them, that
no means should be left untried for their recovery and reconciliation.
O, what shall we render to the Lord for all his benefits!</p>

<p>Having been very unwell, as before observed, most of the last
week, I found it necessary to lay by a day or two, which we did
at the house of our friend John Talbot. With a little rest I soon
found myself better, and being desirous to improve the time, we
again proceeded. On fourth day, the 16th of the month, we
were at Concord meeting, at Wilmington on fifth day, Centre on
sixth day, Hockesson on seventh day, and at Kennet on first
day. I was helped to get through the service of these meetings
to my own satisfaction and peace of mind; although some of
them were very trying and exercising, by the unfaithfulness and
great want of a right concern and zeal, for the support and
maintenance of our Christian testimonies, which in some families
were very much neglected and let fall. I was led forth generally
in those meetings, in close searching testimonies, tending to
arouse friends from their bed of ease and carnal security; brought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[Pg 146]</span>
upon them by an inordinate love of the world, and an increase of
temporal blessings; in which their principal enjoyments were too
much centered, loving the gifts and forgetting the Giver. I
laboured fervently among them, especially in the last meeting,
wherein my mind was largely opened to unfold to the audience
many of the deep mysteries of the gospel state, making them
plain and easy to be understood by the most ignorant, whose
minds were in any degree turned to inquire the way to Zion.
It was a season in which the Lord’s power was manifested in an
eminent degree, breaking down and contriting many hearts, and
truth appeared to reign triumphantly over all, to the praise of
<i>his</i> grace who is God, blessed for ever.</p>

<p>The following week we attended meetings at Birmingham,
Willistown, Goshen, Westchester, Bradford and Marlborough.
These were mostly pretty full meetings, and generally favoured
and satisfactory. In some of them, as in many foregoing opportunities,
the Lord’s power was eminently exalted, and set above,
and over, all errour and untruth.</p>

<p>On first day, the 27th of the month, we attended two very
large meetings. One in the morning at London Grove, and
the other in the afternoon at New Garden. In both of these
meetings, my mind, I trust, was opened by that divine key,
which, when it opens, none can shut, and when it shuts, none
can open. I was strengthened to declare largely of the things
of God, and the way to eternal life; to the satisfaction and peace
of my own mind; and I trust to the edification and instruction,
as well as conviction and reproof, of many present; the spirit
assisting to divide the word severally to every one, according to
the necessity of their different states. It was a day thankfully
to be remembered.</p>

<p>In the course of this week we attended meetings at West
Grove, East and West Nottingham, Eastland, and Little Britain.
These were all satisfactory seasons; that at East Nottingham
particularly, was a heart-searching opportunity, wherein truth
was raised powerfully into dominion over all. Many were broken
and contrited, and a number wept freely for a considerable time:
surely it was the Lord’s doing, and marvellous in our eyes. On<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[Pg 147]</span>
seventh day we crossed the river Susquehannah, and rode into
the neighbourhood of Deer Creek; and attended the meeting
there on first day. This also proved a very precious meeting,
wherein the Lord’s power was eminently manifested; and every
mind appeared to be humbled by its blessed influence. The
meeting ended with solemn supplication. The two following
days, we attended meetings at Little Falls and Gunpowder.
After the latter meeting, we rode to Baltimore; and the two following
days, attended Friends’ meetings there for the Western
and Eastern Districts, as they came in course. At the close of
each, their monthly meetings were held, which were exercising
seasons, but ended to pretty good satisfaction. There appeared
to be a concerned remnant in each meeting, through whose care
the discipline appeared to be pretty well supported. After the
latter, we left the city and rode to Elk Ridge, to attend a meeting
appointed for us there the next day, the sixth of the week; which
was a satisfactory opportunity. The day after, we attended
Indian Spring meeting. It was a solemn, and I trust profitable
season to some: may it remain with them as bread cast upon
the waters, that may be found after many days.</p>

<p>After this meeting, we rode to the city of Washington; and
the next day, being the first of the week, and the 11th of 7th
month, we attended a meeting there in the morning; and in the
afternoon one at Alexandria. These were both very hard trying
meetings; the people appeared very destitute of real religious
engagement, their minds being so swallowed up in their political
controversies, and other worldly concerns, that there seemed to
be very little room in their thoughts for any thing else. I felt
but little satisfaction in these meetings, except a consciousness of
having done my duty, in laying before them, in a plain manner,
divers truths necessary for them to be in the practice of, and
without which they could not be real Christians, nor obtain an
inheritance in the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p>The three following days we attended meetings at Georgetown,
Sandy Spring, and Elk Ridge. We had been at the latter
place the week before on sixth day. These were seasons of
favour: many truths of the gospel were, I trust, clearly opened<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[Pg 148]</span>
to the people, accompanied with right authority, humbling many
minds, and truth reigned over all. After the last meeting, we
rode to Baltimore that afternoon, and attended a meeting previously
appointed for us at the fifth hour; and the next day
Friends’ meeting in the Eastern District was held, and public
notice was given of our intention of attending it. These were
both full meetings, in which I was led forth in two large doctrinal
testimonies, I trust, to the edification and comfort of many
minds.</p>

<p>After this I felt easy and clear to leave the city. We proceeded
that afternoon about fourteen miles on our way towards Little
York, in Pennsylvania; where we arrived the next day a little
before evening. On seventh day we had a comfortable instructive
meeting there. We then rode to Columbia, crossing the
river Susquehannah in our way. The next day being first day,
we attended Friends’ meeting there. It was large for that place,
more came than the house could contain; and was a favoured
season; the Lord’s power was manifest, and truth reigned over
all; and I was made to rejoice, under an humbling sense of his
continued mercy and gracious assistance from day to day;
wherein we had cause often to set up our Ebenezer, and say, in
the language of one formerly, “hitherto hath the Lord helped
us.”</p>

<p>The three following days, we attended meetings at Lampeter,
Sadsbury, and Doe Run. In these, our gracious helper, whom
we waited upon, and trusted in, manifested himself to be a God
near at hand, and a present helper in every needful time;
and was not only mouth and wisdom, tongue and utterance;
but likewise sealed the truths communicated by the attendant
evidence of his own power, humbling and contriting many
hearts and bringing all under subjection to the authority of truth;
so that I had often in deep thankfulness of heart, to query like
David: “What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits
towards me.”</p>

<p>We then proceeded, attending meetings at Fallowfield, East
Caln, Downingstown; and on first day, the 25th of 7th month,
were at Uwchlan meeting. It was, I trust, a profitable instructive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[Pg 149]</span>
season, as were also the three foregoing; and I found peace in
my labours, which I esteem above all.</p>

<p>On second day we crossed the river Schuylkill, in our way to
Plymouth; where, by previous notice, we had a meeting appointed
at the fourth hour in the afternoon, which we accordingly attended.
The next day we had an appointed meeting at Abington.
These were both large meetings, in which the Lord’s
power was felt to preside. The latter especially was a very
comfortable satisfactory meeting, wherein many truths of the
gospel were opened to the people’s consideration, and they pressed
to an engagement of mind to realize them in their own experience;
and were shown the great and singular advantage and
benefits, that would most certainly result to them and to society,
in their so doing. The Lord’s power was manifest, and truth
reigned over all opposition.</p>

<p>The four following days we were at Byberry, Middletown,
Bristol, and the Falls. These were large meetings, wherein,
through gracious assistance, my mind was strengthened to labour
largely in the gospel; endeavouring, by plain and conclusive
arguments, drawn from scripture testimony and their own experience,
to gather the minds and attention of the people, from
every non-essential and false trust, home to the sure foundation,
the elect precious corner stone, which is Christ in them, the hope
of glory. These were solemn seasons, wherein the people’s
minds were generally humbled, the honest-hearted comforted, the
youth encouraged and instructed, and the lukewarm and refractory
cautioned and reproved. The Lord’s power was exalted
over all, rejoicing the sincere-hearted, and giving peace to my
own mind.</p>

<p>The next day being first day, and 1st of 8th month, we
attended Trenton meeting in the morning, and were at Stony
Brook at five in the afternoon. The meeting at Trenton was
considered to be the largest that had ever been held in that place.
It was a favoured precious meeting, wherein the Lord’s power
was eminently manifest; and my spirit was made to rejoice
and joy in the God of my salvation, who had made bare his arm
of divine sufficiency; and as I trusted in him, carried me through,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[Pg 150]</span>
and over, every trial and tribulation, that attended in the course
of this journey; enabling me to labour faithfully in the work of
the gospel, I trust to the exaltation of his own righteous cause,
and to the peace and comfort of my own mind.</p>

<p>These meetings closed my visit in those parts. We then proceeded
directly to New-York, where we arrived on third day;
and as Friends’ monthly meeting there was to be held the next
day, we concluded to stay and attend it. I then rode home and
found my family well, for which favour, together with the Lord’s
other multiplied mercies and blessings, conferred in the course of
my pilgrimage through this vale of tears, inspire my heart with
gratitude and thanksgiving to the great and blessed Author of
my being and well-being, “who is over all, God blessed for
ever.”</p>

<p>Fifth day, 5th of 8th month, 1813. On this, and the two following
days, I made preparations for again entering into the
necessary cares of my family.</p>

<p>First day. After a pretty close exercise in silence in our meeting
to-day, I was led to call Friends’ attention to more strict
watchfulness and circumspection, and to show the necessity of
advancing in the work of righteousness, and not to continue any
longer at ease in a formal customary way, which is sure to produce
dwarfishness and death, not only to individuals, but also
languor and dulness in meetings, greatly distressing to the
living exercised members.</p>

<p>The following week was spent in my common vocation as a
farmer; except that on seventh day, I went to Setauket, about
thirty miles, to visit a sick Friend, who had lately been received
a member. We had a meeting with her and some of her neighbours
on first day, after which I returned home that evening.</p>

<p>Second, third, and fourth days, passed, as usual, in a peaceful
attention to my ordinary vocations.</p>

<p>Fifth day. At meeting to-day my mind was solemnly humbled
in a fresh commemoration of the gracious dealings of our
heavenly Father towards the workmanship of his holy hand,
especially to his revolting and backsliding creature man; whom,
in great mercy, he is visiting and revisiting in the midst of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[Pg 151]</span>
iniquities, inviting him in loving kindness to repent and return,
that he may bring back his soul from the pit, and be enlightened
with the light of the living.</p>

<p>Sixth and seventh days. Was occupied with my temporal
concerns, which were trying, through indisposition of body, and
much poverty of mind.</p>

<p>First day. I attended our meeting to-day, not so much with
an expectation of comfort, as from a sense of real duty, as my
bodily indisposition and poverty of spirit still continued; nevertheless,
my mind, soon after I took my seat, was opened into a
view of the great hurt man has sustained by suffering himself to
be led and governed by his external senses. It is through these
avenues that he is principally exposed to temptation in this probationary
state. And had he watchfully attended to the internal
sense and voice of God to his soul, which his dependent state
justly required of him, the tempter would have found no more
place in him, than he did in the blessed Jesus. Hence the way
of our return lies open before us, through the grace of God or
Comforter, by which the internal sense of the soul is again arrested,
and strict obedience to its dictates required; and if yielded to in
uprightness and faithful submission, the external senses are
thereby subjected and regulated, and every undue desire and
passion subdued, and the creature returns a willing subject to the
Creator, and primitive harmony is restored. I had largely to
communicate on this subject, and to show to the auditory how
wonderfully gracious and merciful the Lord is, who in longsuffering
and loving kindness is dispensing to every state, according to
its necessities, not suffering even a sparrow to fall without his
heavenly notice.</p>

<p>The rest of this week was spent in my ordinary vocations.
My farming business was very pressing, and it being difficult to
procure suitable assistance, my mind was over-burdened with
care, which seldom fails of producing leanness of spirit in a lesser
or greater degree.</p>

<p>First day, the 29th of 8th month. Attended our meeting in
silence. Oh! what a precious enjoyment to know both soul
and body in humble silence, prostrated at the throne of grace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>Second day. Had invitations to attend the funerals of two
deceased women Friends on the day following. One of them
had been lately, at her request, received into membership by our
monthly meeting, but was never able to attend, she living in
the town of Setauket, far distant from Friends. We had a meeting
at her funeral agreeably to her request. It was a large
solemn one. A number of the inhabitants of the town attended,
and many, although generally strangers to us, were glad of the
opportunity, and appeared well affected therewith. The rest of
this week was spent about home in my usual avocations.</p>

<p>First day, the 5th of 9th month. Attended the indulged
meeting at Jerusalem, which, in the main, I think was a favoured
season, although somewhat hurt in the forepart by an unsavoury
appearance in the ministry.</p>

<p>Second, third, and fourth days. Was occupied in attending
to my farming business, which, for want of suitable, faithful
labourers, is often attended with much care, and too much bodily
labour for my time of life, but which cannot well be avoided
without my business suffering.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended our preparative meeting, at which our
overseers brought forward information of one of our members
having through unwatchfulness and want of faithful attention
to the witness of truth in his own mind, given way repeatedly
to use strong drink to excess. This information affected my
mind in degree, both with joy and sorrow. I was glad, because
from my knowledge of the case, I fully believed it had been too
long procrastinated, not only to the hurt and loss of the individual;
but also, had brought reproach upon the society, and
wounded the noble cause we are engaged to espouse. And it
was cause of real sorrow, when I was brought to reflect on the
distressed state of the individual, and the great affliction it must
necessarily produce to his wife and children, and near connexions.
O how necessary to keep up a steady watch and warfare,
against this sore evil which destroys so many tens of thousands
of the children of men, both in soul and body.</p>

<p>A few following days were spent in much bodily pain from a
supposed rheumatic complaint in one of my limbs. O how needful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[Pg 153]</span>
a virtue is patience in seasons of affliction, to keep us from ungrateful
murmurings: by which men and women often greatly
offend their gracious and beneficent Creator, who designs nothing
but good to his creature man in all the varied dispensations of
his divine providence.</p>

<p>First day. At our meeting to-day, I was led to show to the
people the great harm and loss neighbourhoods, as well as the
community at large, sustain for want of a careful submission to
the laws, in all points where they do not interfere with conscience;
and that those who from their licentious and immoral
pursuits, were often transgressing against the moral precepts of
the law, were not worthy of living in a free country, while violating
the civil policy thereof merely to gratify their own creaturely
and selfish inclinations. An honest and faithful attention to
the moral law of the country we live in, will, in a certain degree,
(as the apostle expressed in allusion to the law of Moses,) be as
a schoolmaster to lead to Christ. He only who is faithful in the
unrighteous mammon, is likely to make any proficiency in
obtaining the true riches.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended our monthly meeting; at the first sitting
of which, my mind was opened into a clear view of the
necessity of our coming to experience a resurrection from a state
of spiritual death, to a renewal of spiritual life, through the resurrection
of Christ, by his life and power in us; as nothing short
of that can give full and satisfactory evidence of his, and our
resurrection, from the dead. On this internal testimony our
whole salvation depends; and we know and feel, that because
he lives we live also; and the life that we now live, is by faith
in the Son of God, hence we come to know in our own experience
what Paul meant when he thus expressed himself: “my
little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be
formed in you.” <i>Christ formed in us</i> is the sum and substance
of the gospel state.</p>

<p>Sixth and seventh days. Spent in manual labour, a reasonable
portion of which I consider my duty and delight; and the
more my delight, because I esteem it my reasonable and Christian
service: and as I also abhor idleness and sloth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>First day. Sat our meeting in silence under a pretty long
testimony of a ministering Friend on a visit to us, who introduced
his communication with the following saying of Christ:
“Except ye eat my flesh and drink my blood, ye have no life in
you; for my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed:”
and to show that it was to be spiritually understood and internally
received, he further added: “The words that I say unto
you, they are spirit and they are life.” An excellent subject
indeed, and while he kept to his text and the subject, it seemed
lively; but he after a time departed from it, and the life, I thought,
very much departed with it. How very necessary it is for
ministers to keep a steady eye to the openings of truth, and not
suffer any premature birth to rise up and get in and scatter their
attention. For want of this care, I have often thought many good
openings have been much lost, and the work thereby marred.</p>

<p>First day, the 10th of 10th month. Alas! how fleeting is
time: three weeks have elapsed since my last note; in the course
of which I have attended two funerals. Take care, oh my soul!
and do not grow careless and forgetful when drawing near to
the eve of life; lest the world and its cares get in and choke the
bubblings of the celestial spring, through the abundant cumber
that seems necessarily attendant on my present state in striving
to help and comfort others.</p>

<p>First day, the 17th of 10th month. Passed the last week
principally in attending to my outward avocations, except attending
the funeral of a young man, where we had a solemn opportunity.
I was exercised publicly to set forth the necessity and
great propriety of an early and timely preparation for death; and
to show to the people the way and means by which it only can
be effected; founded on the declaration of the apostle Paul, where
he asserts that, “not by works of righteousness which we have
done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of
regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost.” The opportunity
closed with comfort and peace of mind, which is the true crown
of all.</p>

<p>I sat our meeting to-day in silence, feeling nothing to exercise
my mind in a communicative way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[Pg 155]</span></p>

<p>Seventh day. Spent this week mostly in the busy round of
outward cares, in my temporal concerns; except attending our
monthly meeting on fifth day, and our select meeting for Ministers
and Elders on sixth day. In both of these my mind was
exercised on account of the apparent languor respecting the right
management and want of firmness in the execution of our discipline,
even in Ministers and Elders; by which reason the society
were very much enveloped in a state of weakness.</p>

<p>First day. Felt my mind clothed with great weakness, and
a feeling sense of my own insufficiency, while sitting in our
meeting to-day; nevertheless, I was led to view in prospect and
contemplation, the great and essential advantages which result to
individuals, and society in general, by a strict and steady
attendance of religious meetings, from a real sense of duty; as
there is scarcely any thing in the outward conduct of men and
women, which more fully denotes a mind fixed on God its
maker for support and countenance, while passing through the
changes and vicissitudes of this mortal life. The subject spread
and led to communication, and opened to a large field of doctrine,
in which the gospel was preached in the authority of truth, and
a very comfortable solemnity covered the meeting.</p>

<p>Third day. Attended the funeral of an acquaintance, a convinced
person; it being his request on his death-bed; and also
that a meeting might be held at his funeral. It was accordingly
so ordered, and proved a very solemn affecting season, particularly
so to the near connexions of the deceased. The Lord was graciously
near, furnishing ability to bear ample testimony to many
truths of the gospel. The people were very attentive, and many
hearts were broken and contrited, and the Lord’s name and power
exalted over all.</p>

<p>Seventh day. The three preceding days I attended our quarterly
meeting, which was held at this time at Flushing. The
meeting of Ministers and Elders, and the meeting for discipline
were very trying heart-searching seasons. The meeting for
worship was a quiet favoured meeting. We had great cause to
acknowledge the goodness and continued mercy of Israel’s Shepherd,
who not only furnished wisdom and ability to search out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[Pg 156]</span>
the hidden things of Esau, or the first nature; and to set judgment
upon the head of the transgressing nature, in those meetings
set apart for the well-ordering of the affairs of the church:
but also graciously condescended in the closing meeting held for
worship, to gladden our hearts by the effusions of his love,
causing the light of his countenance to shine upon us. The
minds of the faithful were influenced to return thanksgiving and
praise to his ever adorable name, who remains to be “God over
all, blessed for ever.”</p>

<p>First day. Sat our meeting in silence, and was much interrupted
by the intrusion of unprofitable thoughts, against which
I had to struggle through most part of the meeting.</p>

<p>Second and third days. Spent in my necessary avocations;
but not without considerable fear attending, lest my temporal
concerns too much intrude and indispose my mind for heavenly
meditations. Nothing material occurred the rest of the week.</p>

<p>First day. Silence as to words sealed my lips through the
meeting again to-day; and may they remain shut in all our
solemn meetings, unless opened by the key of David.</p>

<p>In the course of this week I attended the funerals of two
Friends; at both of which meetings were held. In the first, my
mind was largely opened on the subject of religion; wherein I
was led to show to the auditory, that a right consideration and
frequent remembrance of our latter end, tended to lead into the
realities thereof; which consist in nothing but acts of real obedience
and humble submission to the manifested will of our heavenly
Father, through the inspiration of his grace and light in
our own hearts. As we are careful to have this in our daily
experience, it qualifies to answer the great end for which we were
created, to glorify God and enjoy him; and be thereby prepared
to meet death with an even and tranquil mind, having
known its sting, which is sin, taken away by the death of the
cross. I was also led to expose the doctrine of personal and unconditional
predestination and election; and to show the fallacy
and inconsistency thereof with the divine character.</p>

<p>In the latter meeting I was concerned to show the dangerous
and hurtful tendency of our submitting to be led and governed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[Pg 157]</span>
by the customs and manners of others, without a strict and careful
examination thereof; and bringing them to the test of the
light in our own conscience. For although the frequency of a
thing, and an habitual conformity to that which is not right,
often blunts the edge of conviction, and reconciles us to that
which is contrary to truth, and derogatory to our true interest;
yet the custom of sinning will not lessen its guilt. For in the
awful day of final decision, all our fig-leaf coverings will be torn
off, and things will then appear as they really are; and we shall
all stand in need of that substantial covering, represented by the
coats of skins, which the Lord made for our first parents, and gave
them in lieu of their fig-leaves; that is, something of their own
inventing, that so their nakedness might no longer be exposed.</p>

<p>My mind was also opened to set forth the design and end of
the shadowy or law dispensation; and that by its consistency
and harmony in all its parts, it was a just figure and representation
of the gospel state and dispensation. Many of its precepts
were not good, nor consistent with the justice and mercy of the
all-beneficent and gracious Jehovah; but were only so, as they
stood in relation to the very low, degraded and wicked state of
mankind at that time; and were therefore justly suited to Israel’s
state, and the states and conditions of the surrounding nations
concerned therein, as saith Ezekiel: “Wherefore I gave them
also statutes that were not good, and judgments whereby they
should not live.”</p>

<p>First day, the 14th of 11th month. Attended Cow Neck
meeting to satisfaction.</p>

<p>The rest of this week I spent at home, being closely engaged
in business, and in making preparation for the more comfortable
accommodation of my stock through the inclemency of the approaching
winter; considering that a merciful man is merciful
to his beast; and as I consider it not right to keep in my possession,
and under my immediate notice, any more of the animal
creation than I can render reasonably comfortable.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended our monthly meeting, in which my
mind was engaged to show the great benefit that would result to
society, and to its members as individuals, by a right exercise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[Pg 158]</span>
and faithful execution of our discipline, without fear or favour;
and that some cases of disorder in an individual might turn up,
which, with its attendant circumstances, might render it not only
necessary to disown the person, but would also prove more to his
true interest, and the advancement of the cause and testimonies
that we as a people are engaged in, than the reception of any
untimely or unseasonable acknowledgment could possibly be.
For I have always considered it required, not only deep and solid
consideration, but suitable time of waiting, in order rightly to
qualify a person to make an acknowledgment for an offence committed
against a religious society.</p>

<p>First day. My mind was closely engaged, and largely opened,
to show the inconsistency and unrighteousness of a conformity
to the vain and foolish customs of the world; demonstrating
from the scriptures, that in all ages since the fall of our first
parents, the customs of men and women in their natural estate,
were vain, and that there was a certain degree of wickedness
attached to every vanity; hence the necessity of our carefully
guarding against the conformity to any custom or tradition, until
we have first brought it to the test of the light in our own consciences,
and the reason of things; and also to its consistency
with the precepts and example of our Lord Jesus Christ: and
if relating to our duty towards our fellow creatures, examine
whether it comports with that most excellent rule given by him
as a criterion of conduct: “All things whatsoever ye would that
men should do to you, do ye even so to them; for this is the law
and the prophets.”</p>

<p>Second, third, and fourth days. Nothing particular occurred.
On fifth day I was invited to the funeral of a friend who was a
member of Bethpage particular meeting, which I attended.
After the interment a solemn meeting was held, in which my
mind was largely opened to set forth to the people, the great
necessity, as well as wisdom and propriety, of an early preparation
for death; and showing them the way whereby it could only be
rightly effected. It was a season of renewed visitation to a remnant,
and many hearts were broken and contrited.</p>

<p class="chap-head">Engagements at and about home, 1813 and 1814.</p>


<p>First day, the 28th of 11th month, 1813. Feeling my mind
drawn last evening and this morning to attend Friends’ meeting
at Martinicock, I submitted thereto and went alone. In the
forepart of the meeting, I had to combat a spirit of ease and
stupefaction, which is generally prevalent among the worldly-minded,
although they may be pretty steady in attending meetings;
yet it is to be feared with little or no profit, if it be true
what the beloved apostle has affirmed, that: “If any man love
the world, the love of the Father is not in him.” In the latter
part of the meeting I was led to view the excellency of the pacific
principles of the gospel, as promulgated by Jesus Christ and his
apostles; and to show to the people, the very great and essential
benefit and blessing which would result to the professors of
Christianity by a strict adherence and submission thereunto; as
they stand in direct opposition to the spirit of violence and war,
and breathe forth nothing but peace on earth and good will to
men. It proved through mercy a season of favour; many hearts
were contrited, and the faithful and poor in spirit comforted and
strengthened; and my own mind inspired with gratitude and
thankfulness for such unmerited mercy.</p>

<p>First day, the 5th of 12th month. The six working days of
last week were principally spent in my worldly concerns, except
attending our fifth day meeting, and the Charity Society meeting
yesterday; an institution of Friends for educating the children
of poor black people. Our funds, agreeably to the last report of
a settlement with the Treasurer, amount to upwards of thirteen
hundred dollars; the interest of which is yearly expended for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[Pg 160]</span>
above purpose, by a committee of the Society, who superintend
the educating of said children. The directors of the Society are
limited to thirty members, who meet quarterly for the promotion
and oversight of the institution. I attended our fifth day meeting
in silence, and sat our meeting in like manner to-day, in
poverty of spirit, which terminated in a peaceful close.</p>

<p>First day, the 12th of 12th month. At our meeting to-day,
my mind was largely opened to set forth before the people the
difference between the law state and that of the gospel. It was,
I trust, an instructive edifying season, worthy of grateful remembrance.</p>

<p>Second day afternoon I rode to New-York, in order to attend
the meeting for sufferings to be held there the next day. It
opened at the ninth hour. We got through the business at two
sittings, and closed in the evening. Fourth day afternoon I rode
home. Fifth day was our monthly meeting. The meeting for
worship was, I think, a favoured comfortable season; and the
testimonies communicated instructive and edifying: such repeated
favoured seasons make it evident beyond controversy, that we are
still a highly favoured people, and shall be accountable according
to the manifold mercies and blessings bestowed upon us: and
we have great cause often to query, like the psalmist formerly,
“What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits towards
me;” for his mercies are new every morning; great is his
faithfulness.</p>

<p>Sixth and seventh days. Spent in my ordinary concerns;
yet, I trust, my mind was preserved in a state of watchfulness
and care, that what I do, even in my temporal business, may all
be done to the glory of God, and be useful to myself and to
my fellow creatures.</p>

<p>First day, the 19th of 12th month. While silently musing in
our meeting towards the latter part, a subject opened which led to
the necessity of communication, wherein that petition in the
prayer our Lord taught his disciples, viz: “Thy kingdom come;
thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven;” was opened to the
audience; and the necessity of our individually witnessing it fulfilled
in us, as the only medium through which we can obtain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[Pg 161]</span>
salvation, and a preparation for the kingdom of heaven. This
was pressed upon the people, showing from the analogy of things,
that as there is nothing but the Lord’s will done in heaven, a
soul that is not reconciled thereto, cannot enter therein, nor partake
of its celestial enjoyment.</p>

<p>The rest of the week was carefully employed in my household
concerns, with the attendance of our fifth day meeting, agreeably
to my invariable practice when at home, if not prevented by
indisposition. It was a quiet comfortable meeting.</p>

<p>Sixth day. Attended the funeral of our honest friend Richard
Townsend. There was a large collection of Friends and neighbours,
he being generally esteemed. A meeting was held on the
occasion, which proved a very solemn season. The people’s
attention was called to the necessity of a timely preparation for
death, in a large arousing testimony; setting forth the great and
singular advantages which would redound to the children of
men, by their obtaining right ideas and apprehensions of God.
The want of these left them to be led away into a belief of many
strange and ideal notions concerning him, particularly that of
foreordination; the inconsistency of which, my mind was led to
unfold to the auditory, by this and other undeniable arguments;&mdash;that,
as God’s ordination, and God’s creation, and God’s will, are
always in perfect unison, and cannot be diverse one from the
other; and as all that he wills and creates is immutably good,
agreeably to his own declaration in the work of creation; hence,
whatever he ordains must likewise be immutably good: therefore,
if there is any such thing as sin and iniquity in the world,
then God has neither willed it, nor ordained it; as it is impossible
for him to will contradictions. And secondly, if he has, previous
to man’s creation, willed and determined all his actions, then
certainly every man stands in the same state of acceptance with
him, and a universal salvation must certainly take place; which
I conceive the favourers of foreordination would be as unwilling
as myself to believe. And moreover, if man was not vested with
the power of free agency, and a liberty of determining his own
will, in relation to a choice of good or evil, he could not be an
accountable creature; neither would it be in his power to commit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[Pg 162]</span>
sin. It was a time of favour, and the Lord’s blessing on the
labours of the day was reverently supplicated. O, saith my soul,
may they have the desired effect.</p>

<p>First day, the 26th of 12th month. Sat the greater part of
our meeting in much weakness and poverty of spirit, to which I
felt perfectly resigned, believing it to be agreeable to the Lord’s
will. But towards the close an honest elderly Friend, though
young and small in such service, expressed a sentence or two
accompanied with a degree of life, which seemed to give spring
to a concern on my mind, which led to communication. The
subject which opened was to show, that plainness and simplicity
were the true marks and badges of the Lord’s people and children
in every age of the world, witnessed to by the true nature and
analogy of all things in the universe; and confirmed by the
testimony of the grace and good spirit of God through his servants
in all the generations of mankind. The youth were exhorted
and tenderly invited to submit to the <i>cross of Christ</i>,
with the assurance assented to by the experience of all the faithful;
that if they bowed willingly to his yoke, it would become
not only easy but delightful. But alas! how true is that declaration
of the prophet: “who hath believed our report, and to
whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?” Certainly to none but
the obedient, which number, if we are to judge by their fruits, is
doubtless very small.</p>

<p>Second, third, and fourth days. Spent mostly in my temporal
business, but not without a watchful care lest it should engage
too much of my attention. The evenings were partly spent in
reading the scriptures, in which I greatly delight. How excellent
are those records! although old, yet they seem ever new.
The prophecy of Micah was a part of my present reading; what
a dignified sense and clear view he had of the gospel state and
worship; and how exceedingly it lessened the service and worship
of the law in his view, in the clear sense given him of its full
and complete abolishment, with all its shadowy rituals; when
he was led to set forth its insufficiency, in this exalted language:
“Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, and bow myself
before the high God? Shall I come before him with burnt-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[Pg 163]</span>offerings,
with calves of a year old? Will the Lord be pleased
with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil?
Shall I give my first-born for my transgression, the fruit of my
body for the sin of my soul?” No, none, nor all of these were
sufficient to give access to the divine presence, or to the divine
law under the gospel; they being only shadows, and therefore
could only give access to the outward law and outward lawgiver
Moses, and the law and ordinances given by him; which were
also shadows of the true substance. For Moses, and his outward
law and ordinances, stood in the same relation to outward Israel,
under the shadowy dispensation, as Christ the spiritual Moses,
with his spiritual law written in the heart, does to his spiritual
Israel under the gospel; “which is a dispensation not” of shadow,
but of substance; as is clearly shown by the sequel of the testimony
of Micah above alluded to, where he goes on as follows:
“He hath showed thee, O man, what is good;” then certainly
not shadow nor sign, but real substance, “and what doth the
Lord require of thee,” not only by an outward, but by his inward,
divine law, “but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk
humbly with thy God.” This is the sum and substance of all
true religion and worship, and needs not the continuance of any
outward elementary washings or eatings or drinkings; but opens
to the necessity of our drinking at that spiritual river, the streams
whereof make glad the whole heritage of God. For those that
drink thereof will never thirst again, at least for the water of any
other stream.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Sat our meeting to-day in silence. It is not
unpleasant to feel ourselves sometimes circumstanced as Mordecai
formerly, sitting at the king’s gate, and, in its season, is as
grateful to the truly humble and submissive mind, as riding on
the king’s horse, and all bowing before us.</p>

<p>First day, the 2d of 1st month, 1814. Another year is ended.
Oh my soul, how hast thou improved it, and what progress hast
thou made in thy heavenly journey? As I sat in our meeting
to-day, my mind was led to contrast the law and gospel, or
shadow and substance. “While I was musing the fire burned,”
and my heart became warmed within me; “then spake I with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[Pg 164]</span>
my tongue,” and endeavoured in a zeal for the Lord’s cause, to
open to the people, the superiour excellency of the gospel, above
and beyond that of the law, as set forth by the precepts, doctrines,
example and commands of our great and gracious lawgiver Jesus
Christ. The life rose towards the close of the meeting into a good
degree of dominion, through hard labour and toil. For many
professors lie so securely in their graves, that nothing short of the
powerful voice that raised Lazarus formerly, is sufficient to
quicken and raise them therefrom.</p>

<p>Second day. This day principally spent in making provision
more favourably to meet the inclemency of the ensuing winter.</p>

<p>Third day. Spent as yesterday. In the evening read Thomas
Ellwood’s relation of his sufferings and cruel usage from his
father, because, for conscience’ sake, he could not pull off his hat
and stand bare before him; and for using the plain language of
thou and thee, instead of the plural you. Alas! what a spirit of
pride, arrogance and cruelty governs the children of men, while
living in the lusts of their fallen nature, estranged from God
and from his true nature and image. And it is to be feared
that many in this day, who profess to be the successors of those
primitive sufferers, our worthy predecessors, who stood faithful,
and patiently bore the burden and heat of the day, through
many years of cruel persecution, are now turning back like
a broken bow; and through the fear or favour of men, are
disregarding the testimonies which their forefathers in the truth
purchased at so dear a rate; and are ready to account many of
them but small, or as indifferent things, which may, or may not,
be attended to at their own pleasure. But alas for these, it is to
be feared they will never have a view, much less be permitted
to enter the promised land, the heavenly Canaan: but will fall
in the wilderness as did the unbelieving and rebellious in former
ages. I often mourn and take up a lamentation, when I behold
the children of believing parents, turning aside, disobedient to
their parents, and disregarding the travail and exercise of their concerned
Friends, who are labouring for their return: but those who
are faithful to give the watchword in season, will be clear of their
blood, and the Lord will be clear. For he will have a people,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[Pg 165]</span>
and, as formerly, will send his servants into the highways and
hedges, and gather from thence, that his house may be filled:
but those children of the kingdom, who are making excuses, and
will not come when they are bidden, will be cast out into outer
darkness, where will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>

<p>Fourth day. I was occupied as a carpenter, in making some
conveniences for my stock. I felt wearied at evening with the
labour of the day, but was comforted with a peaceful mind, feeling
myself at peace with all men. A blessed privilege; it is the
Lord’s doing, and marvellous in mine eyes.</p>

<p>Seventh day. Attended the funeral of an ancient Friend. A
meeting was held on the occasion, wherein I was exercised in a
large arousing testimony suited to the occasion. May it be to
the honest inquirers, as a nail fastened in a sure place; and to
those who yet remain unwilling to surrender, as bread cast upon
the waters, found after many days.</p>

<p>First day, the 9th of 1st month. At our meeting to-day I was
led to reflect on my frequent appearances in the ministry at home,
and ready to wonder why I was led so often to communicate to
almost the same assembly. But these meditations were soon
superseded by a renewed living concern, which opened again to
communication, in a deep searching testimony; wherein I was
led to show the fallacy and weakness of all man’s creaturely and
carnal reasoning, that it was all estranged from God, and stood
in the ignorance and corruption of his fallen nature; and that
man never had, nor could have, consistent with his nature as a
dependent being, a right to assume a power to use his reason at
his own discretion and will; but only in submission and subservience
to the dictates of the light and spirit of his Creator, as
paramount both to his reason and animal senses. For his reason
is given him as an agent under his Creator, to govern and keep
in due order the animal senses; not according to his own discretion
and will, but agreeable to the manifestations of the divine
spirit, or inward law and will, of his heavenly Father. It was
an humbling season, and many hearts with mine own were
bowed in reverence, under the sensible impress of the divine
power.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[Pg 166]</span></p>

<p>The rest of the week I passed in my usual engagements, and
in visiting some of my friends.</p>

<p>First day, the 16th of 1st month. Sat our meeting in silence
to-day. The three following days I spent in attending to my
usual avocations, and in visiting two of my sick neighbours.
One of them was a young man, who was convinced of the truth,
as held by us, in his young years. He spoke very sensibly of
the work of truth on his mind in the early part of his convincement,
and of the awe that covered his spirit, through the sensible
impressions of the divine power; and recapitulated the precious
seasons he had witnessed in the fields, sitting on rocks, and
stumps of trees; and that he now felt his love to reach forth and
embrace the whole human family. He appeared to be in a
sweet and quiet frame of mind, though so weak, as not to be
able to speak louder than a whisper. What a precious thing it
is when the youth submit willingly to the visitations of divine
love in their tender years; how amiable they appear, and how
peaceful their close; a pearl to be valued above all temporal
enjoyments.</p>

<p>Fifth day. This being the time of our monthly meeting, we
had the company of two Friends on a visit to us. One of them
appeared largely in the line of the ministry, but a fear attended
my mind, lest he had not sufficiently attended to that command,
which forbids sowing our ground with mingled seed; or suffering
a garment of linen and woollen to come upon us: Oh how
necessary it is for all those who apprehend they are called to the
work of the ministry, to know self fully reduced; otherwise they
may be in danger of endeavouring to cover the harlot, with the
Lord’s jewels; and with fair words, and fine speeches, deceive
the hearts of the simple.</p>

<p>Sixth day. Attended our preparative meeting of Ministers
and Elders. I had to drop a caution, founded on the failure of
Moses and Aaron at the rock; when instead of speaking to it, as
commanded, Moses smote it with his rod, with the addition of,
“hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock?”
This act, being the effect of mere creaturely zeal and warmth
of natural passions, lost them much; as it prevented their enter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[Pg 167]</span>ing
into the promised land. Oh how needful it is for those who
are called to stand as a medium between God and the people,
to be deeply attentive to the word of command, and not add
thereto, nor diminish therefrom, under the penalty of his displeasure.
For if he spared not Moses who was only guilty of
this one fault in his administration, how much less can we expect
that he will spare us, if we should add to, or diminish from, the
word of prophecy.</p>

<p>Seventh day. Assisted a sick neighbour to settle his outward
business by writing his will and seeing it executed. I then
endeavoured to stimulate his mind with a concern rightly to
improve the few remaining moments which might be permitted
him on this side the grave; that so he might be prepared to
meet death with a peaceful and tranquil mind.</p>

<p>First day, the 23d of 1st month, 1814. Attended Westbury
meeting, at which there was a funeral of a deceased ancient
woman Friend. It was a large meeting. Many Friends and
neighbours came from a distance to attend the funeral. I had
good service among them in the line of the ministry, by way of
caution, encouragement and reproof; and was led to press upon
the auditory the necessity of a submission of our wills to the
divine will, as the only medium through which we could become
qualified to answer the great end of our creation; which is to
glorify God and enjoy him.</p>

<p>Second day. Attended the funeral of a pious young Friend
of our meeting who departed this life by a consumption, after
lingering a few months. His corpse was carried into our meeting-house
at Jericho. There was a large meeting on the occasion,
and through the prevalence of the divine power that presided
over the assembly, it proved a very solemn time. Many hearts
were broken and contrited by the force of the testimony, which
went forth powerfully clothed with the demonstration of the spirit,
and the Lord’s name was exalted over all.</p>

<p>Seventh day. This being the time of our quarterly meeting,
I was mostly employed through the week in attention thereto.
It was, I think, through the several sittings a solemn searching
time. My mind was closely engaged on several subjects apper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[Pg 168]</span>taining
to our Christian testimonies; but more particularly that
against war, which was now in the land. Friends, with others,
were called upon for supplies by way of taxes to carry it on,
which were levied various ways on the inhabitants. I felt my
mind deeply engaged to lay before Friends the inconsistency of
our actively complying with any such military requisitions, believing
that if we did, we should not only become accessaries in
the war, but should have to bear a part of the guilt of shedding
the blood of our fellow creatures. The Lord’s power was felt to
preside, and the testimonies borne on the occasion were evidently
clothed with divine authority, keeping down all opposition. The
minds of the faithful were inspired with humble gratitude and
thanksgiving to the Lord our gracious helper, under a renewed
sense of his continued mercy to us as a people; and to all the
workmanship of his holy hand.</p>

<p>First day, the 30th of 1st month, 1814. As I was sitting in
our meeting my mind became exercised in contemplating the
danger that some of my fellow professors of the Christian name
are exposed to, by placing their dependence for justification and
salvation on the <i>imputative righteousness of Christ which he
performed without them</i>, without coming to know a complete
remission of their sins, and living a life of righteousness through
faith in the operation of God, and a submission to the work of
<i>his spirit in their minds</i>; by which, according to the apostle’s
exhortation, they can only be enabled to work out their own salvation
with fear and trembling. For it is God that worketh in
the willing and obedient soul, both to will and to do of his own
good pleasure; but this can only be witnessed by such as experience
their own wills to be mortified and slain by the power of
the cross inwardly revealed, whereby the true spiritual atonement
is made. I was largely opened to communicate on some
of these subjects; and to show to the people wherein the true
harmony between the law dispensation, and that of the gospel
consisted. It was a season worthy of grateful remembrance;
the meeting closed with thanksgiving and prayer, under a renewed
sense of the continued mercy of our gracious God, who is
over all, blessed for ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>Second day. Being unwell with a cold I kept house and read.</p>

<p>Third day. Having the evening before received an invitation
to attend the funeral of a deceased neighbour about four miles
distant from my dwelling, and understanding it was the desire
of the deceased on her death-bed that I would attend; I felt
inclined to go, although still unwell. I was glad I gave up
thereto, as it proved, through heavenly help, a solemn instructive
season, wherein my heart and mouth were opened to declare
largely of the way of life and salvation to the people in the clear
demonstration of truth. The assembly in general were bowed
and humbled, and many hearts contrited; to the Lord alone be
the praise, for to him only it is due.</p>

<p>Fourth day. Still unwell: mostly kept house.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Ventured out to our meeting, but was considerably
afflicted with my cold and cough. The meeting was held in
silence.</p>

<p>The two following days, and the forepart of the next week, I
employed, mostly, in preparing for the press a small treatise on
slavery; and on the use of the produce of the labour of slaves.
I laid it before our meeting for sufferings which met this week;
and obtained their concurrence for printing it. As I was in the
city, I attended Friends’ meetings as they came in course on
fourth and fifth days, and returned home on sixth day. Nothing
particular transpired on seventh day.</p>

<p>First day, the 13th of 2d month. Was largely opened in
communication on divers subjects in a very searching testimony,
which brought a covering of great solemnity over the meeting.
The honest-hearted were comforted: but it was a season of sharp
reproof to the unfaithful and lukewarm.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended our monthly meeting, at which nothing
opened worthy of particular notice.</p>

<p>Seventh day. I attended the funeral of the wife of John
Wine, a Friend of Flushing. We had a very solemn meeting
on the occasion, in which I was exercised in a large affecting
testimony, tendering and contriting the hearts of the assembly
in general. The truth was raised into dominion, breaking down
all before its influential searching power; which was cause of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[Pg 170]</span>
deep gratitude and thanksgiving to the Lord our gracious helper,
for his unmerited mercy, still dispensed in his longsuffering
loving kindness to the children of men.</p>

<p>Feeling my mind inclined to sit with Friends here the next
day, which was first day, the people were notified thereof at the
close of the foregoing opportunity. It was a full meeting, in
which truth favoured and furnished with matter suited to the
states of those present; which made it an instructive edifying
season. The canopy of love was felt to spread sweetly and very
comfortably over the assembly, and I parted with them in the
fresh feeling thereof; and with a peaceful mind, and a thankful
sense of the Lord’s mercy.</p>

<p>Nothing particular occurred in the course of the next week;
but the precious savour that was witnessed in the two forementioned
opportunities, remained as a canopy over my mind, and
was cause of humble gratitude and thankfulness to the blessed
Author of all our rich mercies and blessings.</p>

<p>First day, the 27th of 2d month. My mind, in our meeting
to-day, after a considerable time of humble quiet waiting, and
seeking to be gathered to Shiloh, was led in prospect to view the
great and singular advantages which would redound to the children
of men by an early acquaintance with the Lord; and by
continually looking to him, and relying on him, as the primary
and only object of their faith and hope. The prospect enlarged
and opened to a communication, and the truth was raised into a
comfortable degree of dominion, and spread a solemn covering
over the assembly; and many hearts were contrited and made
glad from a feeling sense of the Lord’s mercy vouchsafed to us
at this season. O how good is the Lord, and how greatly to be
praised, for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>

<p>The rest of this week I was occupied in my temporal concerns.
Sat our fifth day meeting in silence, in which I had to maintain
a steady warfare against the intrusion of unprofitable thoughts.
O how precious it is to be favoured to gain a complete victory over
these, and to have the mind brought to witness a profound stillness,
where nothing reigns but Jesus, in his inward spiritual
government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>First day, the 6th of 3d month. In our meeting to-day I had
again to bear testimony against the prevailing evils of the day;
some of which I had to expose, and to show how we must enter
the church militant, if ever we enter right, and become useful
members thereof, and be truly comforted and profited thereby.
The communication was introduced by the parable of the supper,
which shows that those who have something of the pleasures
and treasures of this world to gratify and comfort themselves with,
will not come in, although invited: but those who are brought
to a full sense of their wretched and forlorn condition, without
God and without a Saviour, compared, in the parable, to those
who are poor and destitute of every comfort, and scattered in the
highways and hedges, will seek a place of refuge; and having
tried every means they had in their power, and every invention
that man has sought out in the way of salvation, and after all
finding themselves still left in a state of disappointment, are made
willing to surrender all up, and sell all; that so they may be
enabled to purchase the field wherein the pearl of great price
lies. The word went forth with power, and struck home to
many minds, and a very solemn weight appeared to cover the
assembly in general.</p>

<p>Second, third, and fourth days. Spent in a quiet attention to
my temporal concerns with the attendant blessing of peace of
mind; yet not without some intervals of interruption from the
loose and the vain, with which this neighbourhood is too much
disturbed. Alas, what has so gained the ascendency in and over
the mind of man, as to cause him to delight and take pleasure in
wickedness.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Was our preparative meeting, in which the overseers
brought forward information against one of our members, a
young man, for deviations from plainness, and being guilty of
attending horse races, and suffering his horse to run for a wager;
all which manifest a very thoughtless disposition, and much
vanity of mind, very unworthy the least member in our community.
The meeting felt tenderly for him, as he had not had a
guarded education; he being left an orphan, when small, by the
death of his father. In considering his condition, I was induced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[Pg 172]</span>
to enlist myself voluntarily in the meeting’s service, to pay him
a visit; and the meeting added another Friend to join me therein.
I was likewise engaged in the meeting for worship, to call Friends’
attention to the necessity of greater purification both in body,
soul, and spirit; as the only medium through which we could
gain an inheritance in the kingdom of heaven. I showed by
the analogy of reason, that a purified soul could not be content
to inhabit a polluted body; and that if the inside was made clean,
the outside would be clean also; and that true and genuine
Christianity will lead to cleanliness in our persons, in our houses,
and in all our concerns. All this will proceed from real love and
duty to our Creator, and not from any germ of pride, or vainly
to make a show, but from a real desire of effecting holiness in
the fear of the Lord.</p>

<p>First day, the 13th. A comfortable meeting to-day, mostly
in silence, but closed with solemn supplication, wherein I
was led to set forth how our gracious and beneficent Creator,
although he sees all our wants, and stands always disposed,
before we ask him, to redress all our real grievances, and dispense
good to us whenever he finds us in a condition fit to receive:
yet as he is a God of justice and truth, he delights to see his
people and children grateful and humbly sensible of their dependence
on him for every blessing; therefore, he permits them, at
times, when he sees meet to influence their minds thereto, to
approach his sacred presence in humble and devout prayer, and
which also affords to those who are thus devoted, sweet and
heavenly consolation and joy.</p>

<p>I passed this week mostly at home overseeing my temporal
concerns. Attended our monthly meeting on fifth day, at which
we received information, from the women’s meeting, of the departure
of one of our members, a young woman, who had gone out
in her marriage with one not a member, whom they concluded
ought to be disowned; with which the men’s meeting concurred.
This is a weakness among our young members, which is, in
general, very pernicious in its consequences, and too often happens
through the neglect of care and right concern in parents
and guardians, who, for want of living near the truth, and under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[Pg 173]</span>
right religious engagements themselves, are too often led away
to seek after riches for their children, and are more desirous that
their children should obtain companions who are wealthy and
rich in this world’s treasure, than such as are truly religious and
virtuous. Thus a foundation is often laid, by such indiscreet
parents, for many very unhappy connexions, by which the religious
improvement and advancement of their tender offspring is
often entirely intercepted and prevented, and their prospects of
temporal comfort and joy rendered abortive; and they have to
drag out a miserable existence until death dissolves their obligations.</p>

<p>First day, the 20th. As I sat in our meeting my mind was
brought under exercise in taking a view of the life of Solomon,
that wise king of Israel, as delineated by his own pen; and from
which we learn the insignificance of all consolation and joy
which have their source in temporal and mortal things, as they
must and will end, in vanity and vexation of spirit: and that to
fear God and keep his commandments, is not only the whole
duty of man, but likewise the only blessed and eternal source of
all true joy and never ending felicity. The subject spread on
my mind and led to communication, in which I endeavoured, in
the ability afforded, by persuasive arguments, to engage the minds
of the auditory, both old and young, in the pursuit of that invaluable
treasure that waxeth not old, but endureth for ever, which
will bring true joy to the immortal soul and adds no sorrow.</p>

<p>Nothing particular occurred in the course of this week, except
that a care and fear attended my mind, lest the cares of this world
and the increase of temporal things might too much interrupt, and
intrude, upon my spiritual concerns; for riches are ever deceitful,
and always promise more than they have in their power to perform.</p>

<p>First day, the 27th. Feeling my mind inclined to sit with
Friends at Bethpage to-day, I yielded to the motion and attended
their meeting; and although I had not a great deal to communicate,
yet what I had, appeared to reach home to many minds,
and rendered it a comfortable meeting, not only to myself, but to
the assembly in general. The subject which opened for communication
was the necessity and excellency of integrity; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[Pg 174]</span>
that although we might be so wise and knowing as to comprehend
all knowledge, yet if we were destitute of integrity and
sincerity of heart, we should but share the fate of fools at last,
and be not a whit better for all our wisdom and knowledge.</p>

<p>Second, third, and fourth days. Spent in close attention to
my temporal concerns, the care for which, and for their right
ordering, is constantly necessary; insomuch that I often wonder
how it is, that I sometimes hear people say, they seem at a loss
how to spend their time; when not only my temporal, but in an
especial manner my spiritual concerns, are always urgent and
pressing; so that I find not a moment to be idle: so true is that
declaration of the Most High verified: “In the sweat of thy face
shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out
of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou
return.” The wise man also saith: “All things are full of
labour” therefore we ought not to repine or murmur at our lot, but
receive all, as at the hand of the Lord with thanksgiving.</p>

<p>Fifth, sixth, and seventh days. I attended three funerals, one
on each day successively. The first was a very ancient female,
upwards of ninety years of age, belonging to Westbury meeting.
We had a solemn meeting on the occasion, in which truth favoured,
opening suitable doctrine, and bringing it home to the states of
those present, who were mostly Friends. The hidden things
of Esau, or the first nature, and the secret lurking places of self,
were searched out and exposed; for which my mind, with the
honest-hearted present, was made glad in the Lord, and in the
apparent working of his power and wisdom. The two last
were not members of our society, but were favourably disposed
to Friends. They were seasons of favour. A meeting, was
held at each, and both largely attended by the neighbouring
inhabitants. The doctrines delivered were well adapted to the
conditions of the hearers, and were brought home to many minds
in the demonstration of truth, breaking and contriting many
hearts; and thanksgiving and praises were returned to the
Shepherd of Israel, as a tribute of gratitude for such unmerited
mercies.</p>

<p>First day, the 3d of 4th month. Our meeting to-day was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[Pg 175]</span>
favoured with the overshadowing wing of divine truth, and its
power exalted over all, contriting and comforting many minds.
But alas, what small advancements are made by many of those
who are often dug about and watered by the compassionate
Shepherd of Israel, whose mercy is still eminently dispensed to
man, the workmanship of his holy hand.</p>

<p>I attended two funerals in the course of this week, one on fifth
day, after the sitting of our preparative meeting, and the other on
sixth day. Both were young men in the prime of life. The
latter unmarried, and was a relation to my wife. His parents
had a healthful family of children, and had never met with the
like trial before. It was therefore a very affecting scene both to
them and their children; they having been before favoured with
almost an unbroken scene of worldly prosperity, which made the
wound sink deeper. We had a very solemn meeting on the
occasion, wherein I was largely opened to preach the gospel in
the demonstration of truth; and among other things to show to
the people, the necessity and sure felicity of an early preparation
for death; and that God was the alone proper object for man to
set his heart and affections upon. The auditory were mostly
not in membership with Friends. Many of them were much
broken and contrited, and a general, and very precious solemnity
was spread over the meeting. The hearts of many were made
glad, from a sense of the Lord’s continued and unmerited goodness
and mercy to the children of men; still showing his unwillingness
that any should die in their sins, and that all might
repent, turn to him and live.</p>

<p>First day, the 10th. I had a hard suffering meeting to-day,
in which I witnessed not only deep inward poverty, but had to
struggle with unprofitable thoughts, with very little ability to
maintain the warfare; yet, under the consideration that it was
altogether as good, if not better, than my deserts could justly
require, I was preserved from murmuring or complaining at my
lot, being willing to receive evil as well as good, at the hand of
my gracious and compassionate Lord, when he sees meet to permit
or dispense it. “Shall we receive good at the hand of God,
and shall we not evil?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[Pg 176]</span></p>

<p>The rest of this week was principally occupied in a close
application to my temporal concerns, except attending our
monthly and select preparative meetings, which came at this
time. My belief was similar to the apostle’s, that he who is not
carefully industrious to labour for his own and household’s comfortable
support, may be considered to have denied the faith, and
is worse than an infidel; as they are generally careful on those
accounts.</p>

<p>First day, the 17th. The meeting to-day was pretty open and
comfortable. The rest of the week was mostly taken up in
attending our quarterly meeting, held at New-York at this time.</p>

<p>First day, the 24th. Sat our meeting mostly in silence.</p>

<p>Second, third, and fourth days. Were taken up principally
in caring for my temporal concerns. Alas, how much precious
time is expended for the accommodation of those houses of clay,
which must shortly return to the dust from whence they were
taken; and which often burden, and too much indispose the
mind for heavenly and spiritual meditations, unless carefully
watched and strongly guarded against.</p>

<p>Fifth day. I was wholly silent in our meeting to-day; in the
course of which I had full evidence of the truth of that saying of
the great Master, that of ourselves, without him, we can do
nothing.</p>

<p>Sixth and seventh days. Were accompanied with heart
searchings, discouragement, and dismay; in which I witnessed
the truth of that saying, that vain is the help of man, whose
efforts often tend more to sully and weaken, than to brighten
and strengthen the minds of those they strive to help. This is
principally owing to their dwelling on the surface, and judging
from the outward appearance, instead of digging deep in search
of the mind of truth, which only can enable to judge with righteous
judgment.</p>

<p>First day, the 1st of 5th month. Sat our meeting in silence,
and in much poverty of spirit; and when the season for closing
the meeting seemed near at hand, I looked over the assembly,
which was pretty large, with a degree of sympathy and commiseration,
which brought to my remembrance the compassionate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[Pg 177]</span>
saying of our Lord to his disciples, on, as I apprehended, a similar
occasion, viz: “If I send them away fasting to their own
houses, they will faint by the way.” This put a stop to my mind
with regard to closing the meeting; and as I knew I had nothing
to give, I looked around to see what was to be done. A friend
then stood up with something comparable to the five loaves and
the two fishes, which were found formerly in the lad’s basket.
As they were broken, she handed them to the company, until all
appeared satisfied; for which I was thankful.</p>

<p>Seventh day. The week hath passed away. Oh time, precious
time, how swift thou passest on, by us almost unenjoyed
and unimproved! How soon thou wilt land thy travelling pilgrim
in the house appointed for all living; where, oh my soul,
thou knowest there is no repentance nor amendment known!
Prepare then, oh prepare, for thy final change!</p>

<p>First day, the 8th of 5th month. A poor silent meeting until
near the close, when a little light sprang up and dispelled the
darkness, and sweetened all the bitter. By such things we are
instructed, and learn to know our dependent state, and that it is
the Lord’s doings, and marvellous in our eyes.</p>

<p>Nothing uncommon transpired in the course of this week,
save as usual, bonds and afflictions for the gospel’s sake, spiritually
and inwardly experienced, await me; from a view and
sense of the spread of evil, and the great want of faithful testimony-bearers
in society; and the languor and weakness which
abound; that I am sometimes almost involuntarily led to cry,
alas for the day.</p>

<p>First day, the 15th. My mind was deeply exercised in our
meeting to-day on divers important subjects, and largely led forth
in communication: but for want of a more full openness and
preparation in the auditory to receive, the labour was arduous
and exercising, yet I trust profitable to some.</p>

<p>The rest of the week was employed in my usual attention to
my necessary temporal concerns, and an unfailing attention to
those of a religious nature. Our monthly meeting was held this
week. The meeting for Ministers and Elders belonging to the
yearly meeting was held on seventh day, at the tenth hour,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[Pg 178]</span>
which my wife and myself attended. It was, I think, in a good
degree a favoured time; as were the public meetings on first day,
both forenoon and afternoon. On second day the yearly meeting
for discipline opened at the tenth hour, and continued by adjournments
until fifth day evening. It was for the most part a comfortable
profitable season, evidencing in the several sittings, that
the Lord had not forsaken his people, but was still graciously
manifesting his presence and power for our comfort and help, in
ordering the affairs of the Church. On sixth day Friends turned
their faces towards home, where I arrived at evening with my
wife and two youngest daughters, who constitute my present
family, except servants.</p>

<p>The next day I felt myself in a cheerful readiness to put my
hands to whatever they found to do, as right to be done.</p>

<p>First day, the 29th. Felt myself so much indisposed with a
cold and considerable pain of body, as to be prevented from attending
our meeting to-day; in reflecting thereon, and how very
seldom I had been thus prevented for many years past, my mind
was filled with gratitude and thankfulness to our gracious Helper
and Preserver, for the portion of bodily health allotted me in the
course of his divine providence; whereby, I have been almost
invariably of ability of body for a number of years, to attend all
our religious meetings, which I consider and number among our
chiefest blessings and benefits.</p>

<p>The latter end of this week I joined our friend William Flanner,
who was here on a religious visit from Ohio; and attended
a number of meetings in divers places, where no meetings of our
society were held. I had had a prospect of visiting those places
some time before. We were out three days and attended five
meetings. The first was with Friends at Bethpage, the rest
among people inclining to Friends, and those of other professions.
They were, I think, all favoured seasons. The Lord’s presence
and power were manifested for our help, furnishing ability to
minister suitably to the different states of the people, in the demonstration
of the spirit. Many hearts were humbled and contrited,
and the assemblies solemnized, and truth raised into
dominion over all; and our hearts were made glad under an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[Pg 179]</span>
humbling sense of the continuation of the Lord’s mercy and
compassion, still extended to the children of men. We returned
home on first day evening, the 5th of 6th month.</p>

<p>The three following days I was about home, mostly employed
in my temporal concerns.</p>

<p>On sixth day attended the funeral of a friend of Westbury
meeting. It was a solemn time, in which I found it my place
to be an example of silence. Seventh day spent at home. On
first day, the 12th of 6th month, I attended two meetings, by
appointment, among those not of our society. One in the morning
at Cold Spring, and the other at four o’clock in the afternoon
at Huntington. They were both seasons of extensive labour,
and I hope profitable to some; and productive of peace to my own
mind.</p>

<p>On second day I went to New-York in order to attend the
meeting for sufferings, which I accordingly attended the next
day, and returned home at evening. On fourth day attended to
my temporal concerns with usual industry.</p>

<p>Fifth day attended our monthly meeting, at which several
matters occurred producing exercise to my mind, which led to a
communication of prospects; and although some diversity of
sentiment was expressed, yet I was favoured so to unfold the
subjects, that they were concluded in a general unity.</p>

<p>Sixth and seventh days. Spent in attending to my usual
affairs.</p>

<p>First day, the 19th of 6th month. I was led in our meeting
to-day, to set forth the excellency of real poverty of spirit; as it
is that only, which can produce that truly humble state, to which
the blessing is annexed.</p>

<p>Fifth day. As I was sitting in our meeting enjoying the
especial advantages which are attached to silent meetings, when
the mind is silently prostrated at the throne of grace, and helped
to be sequestered from all intruding thoughts, and wholly centered
in and upon Jehovah, the alone object of worship and adoration;
a subject opened and spread in a way which led to
communication; in which I had to show, that there were but two
proper motives or inducements for our rightly attending religious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[Pg 180]</span>
meetings. The first related to such as were unbelievers, or those
who were ignorant of the right way of worshipping God in and
under the dispensation of the gospel, which according to our
Lord’s declaration to the woman of Samaria, is only to be performed
in spirit and in truth. The principal benefit to these,
is to be informed and instructed; for which more especially,
the Lord hath ordained a ministry in his Church, by means of
instruments rightly qualified therefor, by the baptismal influence
of the Holy Ghost. The second relates to such as are already
instructed and informed, whose judgments are convinced, and
whose motive as it relates to themselves is, to meet together to
wait upon and worship God in spirit and in truth, without any
regard or consideration to any external ministry or means whatever:
as it is only in a state of entire sequestration from every
thing of an outward or external nature, that the soul is permitted
to enter into the holy place, not made with hands; and
admitted into the immediate presence of Jehovah, and rendered
capable of worshipping him, in spirit and in truth, as the gospel
requires.</p>

<p>Sixth and seventh days. Spent in my usual vocation as a
farmer.</p>

<p>First day, the 26th of 6th month. Attended two meetings by
appointment, among those principally not of our society. The
first was held in a Friend’s house at a place called the Half
Hollow Hills. The latter at the fourth hour in the afternoon, at
a village called New Babylon, in the township of Huntington.
It was held in a school-house, and was a large meeting, mostly
of the Presbyterian persuasion. The people behaved very soberly,
becoming the occasion. It was a very solemn favoured season;
many hearts were contrited and made thankful for the opportunity;
and my heart was much enlarged in love to the assembly.
I trust I felt a mutual return of the same feeling from most
present, for which I was made thankful to the Shepherd of
Israel; and for the continuation of his gracious regard in manifesting
his presence, and making bare his arm, for the help of
his devoted servants; showing himself indeed to be a God near
at hand, and a present helper in the needful time, worthy to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[Pg 181]</span>
praised and adored by the children of men, throughout all ages,
world without end.</p>

<p>The rest of this week I spent mostly about home, being closely
engaged in making hay, which for want of suitable help, made it
necessary for me to labour myself, beyond what seemed suitable
for one of my age; but I felt peace of mind in so doing, although
I suffered some pain of body, as the result of my exertion.</p>

<p>First day, the 3d of 7th month. Sat our meeting in silence.
At the third hour in the afternoon attended the funeral of a
deceased neighbour. Although my mind was brought under
some exercise, which led to communication; yet I found very
little relief, owing, as I apprehended, to the prevalence of a libertine
spirit in many present. For these are generally disposed to
mock at, and ridicule every thing serious, or that has the appearance
of religion and godliness: rebellious children who hate the
light, because their deeds are evil, and who take more delight in
revelling and drunkenness than in the fear of the Lord. I often
feel sad for such as these, and my mind goes clothed as it were
with sackcloth, unseen by the world. O, when will they be
awakened to a right sense of their miserable condition! I often
fear that some of them have nearly sinned out their day; and to
whom the scripture declaration will apply: “He that, being often
reproved, hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and
that without remedy.”</p>

<p>Second, third and fourth days. Busily employed in my husbandry
concerns, with my mind clothed with peace towards all
men, and with hope towards God my Saviour: and comforted
at times in the remembrance of that apostolic declaration, where
it is asserted: “We know that we have passed from death unto
life, because we love the brethren.”</p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended our meeting in silence, the fire being
low on the altar.</p>

<p>Sixth and seventh days. Closely engaged in making and
securing hay for the accommodation of my stock the ensuing
winter; as I consider it a duty to provide plenty of good provender
for them, so as to render their lives as comfortable as may be,
whilst under my care.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>First day, the 10th. As I sat in our meeting to-day, my
mind was led into a consideration and prospect of the excellency
and amiableness of justice, and of the vast advantage
which would accrue to the children of men by a strict adherence
thereto; as it would greatly tend to regulate our conduct, both
as it relates to our duty to God our creator, and also to man, our
fellow creature: and therefore ought to be the governing principle
and main spring of all our conduct, as well in our temporal, as
in our spiritual concerns. The subject spread and enlarged and
opened to communication; and, I trust, proved an instructive
comfortable season to some present; and I felt a reward of peace
in my labour.</p>

<p>Second day. Attended the funeral of a deceased neighbour,
who was not a member of our society, but being convinced
of our principles, and inclined to Friends, the family desired a
meeting might be held, which was accordingly agreed to. It
was a large collection of people of various denominations, and a
considerable number of the looser sort. I had an open favoured
time among them, in which the power of truth rose into dominion
over all, humbling and contriting many hearts, and a general
solemnity was felt to cover the meeting to the praise of Him, who
is over all, God blessed for ever.</p>

<p>Third and fourth days. Occupied in my usual concerns, but
did not feel that full peace of mind with my fourth day’s exercise
that is generally my experience, owing, as I apprehended, to a
want of a more full attention to a small intimation respecting
that day’s employment. Remember, oh my soul! that all thy
success in temporals, as well as all thy sweet inward heavenly
consolations, depend upon thy faithfulness and ready submission
to those inward divine intimations; although sometimes small,
they ought to be considered by thee, binding and obligatory, as
the only source from whence all thy true peace and joy are
derived.</p>

<p>Fifth day. This was our preparative meeting, and as it was
the one preceding the quarterly meeting, the queries were read and
answered; but I apprehended in a way not tending to much
profit, either by reason of one or two improper questions being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[Pg 183]</span>
added to the queries of late, which to many Friends appeared
inconsistent to be answered; or from the want of a more lively
spiritual exercise with the members; or both might have had a
share in producing a dull distressing season. No way seemed to
open for any relief, so we had patiently to bear it. And indeed
I thought it required a large share of patience to sit the meeting
through without murmuring; the chariot wheels seemed to go
very heavily on, as though almost sunk in the slough of despond;
but we did what we could, and so left the matter; and I returned
home with a heavy heart, and was preserved, I trust, from murmuring
at my lot.</p>

<p>Sixth day. Spent in gathering in my harvest and some other
small exercises. The day closed with a quiet and peaceful mind.
What a paradise it is when this is our lot.</p>

<p>Seventh day. Visited two Friends who were under some
bodily infirmity. The visits were mutually comfortable. Such
opportunities, when rightly conducted, tend to the increase of
friendship and mutual love.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>


<p class="chap-head">Visit to Purchase, and engagements at and about home, 1814.</p>


<p>First day, the 17th of 7th month, 1814. Feeling my mind
drawn to sit with Friends in their meeting at Westbury, I yielded
to the motion. It proved an exercising meeting&mdash;but little
life to be felt: nevertheless, way opened for a short communication,
pointing particularly to the state of the meeting, which I
hope was profitable to some. At the third hour in the afternoon,
I attended the funeral of a very ancient woman of this neighbourhood,
not a member of our society; but the family desiring
the company of Friends, a number collected with others. It
proved a pretty solemn time. My mind was led to open to the
assembly, the especial advantages which would result to us, as
rational accountable beings, by a timely preparation for death;
and that it was our especial duty, as well as our best interest, to
make it, at all times, the primary object of our concern.</p>

<p>Second, third, and fourth days. Spent principally in family
cares and my husbandry concerns. What a favour it is for
such an active creature as man, possessed of such powers of
body and mind, always to have some employment, and something
for those powers to act upon: for otherwise they would be
useless and dormant, and afford neither profit nor delight.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended our monthly meeting. It was an exercising
season, especially the meeting for worship, which I think
was much hurt by the communication of a Friend in the ministry,
who was this day with us. It was attended with so much
mere creaturely warmth and animation, as to render it unacceptable,
and, as I apprehended, hurtful to the meeting, and the cause
it was intended to advance. What a pity it is that any who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[Pg 185]</span>
apprehend themselves called to this very important work, should
make such grievous mistakes, and wound the minds of the living
sensible members.</p>

<p>Sixth day. Attended our select preparative meeting of Ministers
and Elders. It was, I think, a season of profitable exercise,
in which some of the hidden things of Esau, or the first nature,
were searched out and exposed.</p>

<p>Seventh day. Laboured hard in my harvest field; and,
although sixty-six years of age, I found I could wield the
scythe nearly as in the days of my youth. It was a day of
thankful and delightful contemplation. My heart was filled
with thankfulness and gratitude to the blessed Author of my
existence, in a consideration of his providential care over me, in
preserving me in health, and in the possession of my bodily
powers; the exercise of which were still affording me both profit
and delight: and I was doubly thankful for the continued exercise
of my mental faculties, not only in instructing me how to
exert and rightly employ my bodily powers, in the most useful
and advantageous manner, but also in contemplating the works
of nature and Providence, in the blessings and beauties of the
field; a volume containing more delightful and profitable instruction,
than all the volumes of mere learning and science in the
world.</p>

<p>What a vast portion of the joys and comforts of life do the idle
and slothful deprive themselves of, by running into cities and
towns, to avoid labouring in the field; not considering that this
is one of the principal sources, that the gracious Creator of the
universe has appointed to his creature man, from whence he may
derive great temporal happiness and delight. It also opens the
largest and best field of exercise to the contemplative mind, by
which it may be prepared to meet, when this mortal puts on
immortality, those immortal joys that will ever be the lot of the
faithful and industrious.</p>

<p>First day, the 24th of 7th month. I went to our meeting to-day
in much poverty of spirit, and in full expectation of passing
it in silence; but I had not sat long before my mind was led
into a view of the singular benefit derived to the children of men,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[Pg 186]</span>
by the denial of self, and a daily and faithfully taking up, and
bearing the cross; as it is the only way by which we can come
to experience real sanctification and justification. The subject
spread and opened to communication, in which things were laid
home to the states of many present, in a clear manner; and the
danger of their situations exposed. It brought a solemn covering
over the meeting, for which I was thankful.</p>

<p>Second and third days. I spent in securing my harvest. This
week being the time of our quarterly meeting, the meeting for
Ministers and Elders opened on fourth day at the tenth hour. It
was a season of close search; the deficiencies of Ministers and
Elders were laid open; and the hurtful tendency thereof exposed.
A number appeared deeply concerned, on account of the prevailing
weakness of some in those exalted stations in society. On
fifth day the meeting for discipline was held. It was also a very
searching time, a season of deep exercise to my mind; in which
the hurtful tendency of many apparent deficiencies was laid open
and exposed; and Friends exhorted to greater faithfulness and
diligence, in the right support of those noble testimonies, given us
to bear, for the promotion of righteousness and peace on the earth.
On sixth day was a general public meeting, in which my mind
was enlarged in gospel communication, wherein truth was
exalted and raised into dominion, to the comfort and edification
of many minds; and to the sweet peace of my own. After this
Friends separated to their several homes in much nearness of
affection, and mutual love.</p>

<p>Seventh day. Spent in my temporal concerns.</p>

<p>First day, the 31st of 7th month. A silent meeting to-day,
for which I was thankful. Although faithfully labouring in the
Lord’s vineyard produceth peace and joy to the willing mind, even
should it have to bear the burden and heat of the day; yet when
permitted, a season of rest is also sweet and grateful.</p>

<p>Having for some days past felt my mind inclined to attend the
ensuing quarterly meeting at Purchase, I spent most of this week
in that service. On second day I left home, and returned on
the following sixth day at evening. I felt but little satisfaction
in this short tour of duty, except in one or two visits in Friends’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[Pg 187]</span>
families. Most of the sittings of the quarterly meeting seemed to
be clothed with great weakness, and some of them distressingly
so.</p>

<p>Seventh day. Exercised in my husbandry business; and the
evening closed with a peaceful mind.</p>

<p>First day, the 7th of 8th month. Felt so much bodily indisposition
as to prevent my attending meeting; but even this induced
thankfulness and gratitude, in recollecting how very seldom this
had been my lot for many years. Oh what shall I, a poor
worm, render unto the Lord for all his benefits!</p>

<p>Second, third, and fourth days. Spent principally in looking
to, and overseeing, my temporal business; and still feeling some
slight touches of bodily indisposition, which seemed to announce
this language, in unison with every thing that is mortal, <i>remember
to die</i>.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended our preparative meeting: what a privilege!
the very name points to care, as saying, “Be ye therefore
ready.”</p>

<p>Sixth day. Did as Peter and some of his fellow disciples,
when not directly employed by their Master, but waiting and
watching for his coming.</p>

<p>Seventh day. Laboured in the field; and the day closed with
a quiet and peaceful mind, which I esteem the greatest treasure.</p>

<p>First day, the 14th of 8th month. As I sat in our meeting
to-day, my mind was impressed with the remembrance of the
declaration of the prophet Isaiah, when reproving the house of
Israel, under the similitude of a vineyard, for their backsliding
and breach of covenant and great wickedness, which he closes with
this notable saying: “Therefore hell hath enlarged herself, and
opened her mouth without measure: and their glory, and their
multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, shall descend
into it.” He showed them thereby the natural tendency of evil,
and certain destruction of evil doers, who harden themselves in
sin. The subject opened and led to a large exhortatory and
cautionary communication; also setting forth the great obligations
of parents and guardians to their tender offspring and children
under their charge; and the incalculable loss that children<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[Pg 188]</span>
sustain where parents and guardians neglect their duty in timely
care for their right instruction. It was a solemn time, and I
hope profitable to some, by stirring them up to more diligence.</p>

<p>The rest of this week, except attending our monthly meeting
on fifth day, was spent in close attention to my temporal concerns.
The urgent necessity attending my present business induced
me to labour beyond what my judgment approved; which,
though somewhat painful to the body, was nevertheless, I trust,
free from sin.</p>

<p>First day, the 21st of 8th month. A silent meeting to-day,
which closed with a peaceful mind.</p>

<p>Second, third, and fourth days. Passed without any thing
transpiring worthy of particular notice.</p>

<p>Fifth day. A silent meeting, as it respects myself.</p>

<p>Sixth and seventh days. Spent in my salt-meadows, about
ten miles from home; assisting my men in making and securing
hay. On my return visited a poor widow, with the surplus of
our provisions, for which she was very thankful.</p>

<p>First day, the 28th. My lips, at our meeting to-day, were
closed in solemn silence.</p>

<p>Second, third, and fourth days. Diligently employed in what
my hands found to do: for I see no time when it would be right
to indulge in idleness.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Sat our meeting in much weakness and poverty
of spirit, but felt peace at the close.</p>

<p>Sixth and seventh days. Closely engaged in my temporal
business; but did not forget my accountability to my great Lord
and Master, for the right use of every portion of precious time, he
is pleased to dispense to me.</p>

<p>First day, the 4th of 9th month. My mind, while sitting in
our meeting to-day, was led into a contemplation of the great and
excellent advantages resulting to those, who have placed their
supreme trust in the arm of divine sufficiency; and while musing
thereon, and the manifold blessings attendant on such a state,
there was brought to my remembrance the exhortation of Solomon:
“Trust in the Lord with all thy heart; and lean not
unto thine own understanding.” The subject spread, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[Pg 189]</span>
opened to a communication, in which the audience were pressingly
invited and encouraged to lay hold and make choice of
this only sure rock of refuge, an entire trust and confidence in
God, and in the arm of his salvation. For those who trust in
the name of the Lord, have never been confounded.</p>

<p>The rest of this week was spent in my usual vocations, except
attending our preparative meeting on fifth day. Nothing
transpired worthy of particular notice.</p>

<p>First day, the 11th. As I was sitting in our meeting to-day,
my mind was led into a train of solemn reflection, from the revival
of these expressions of Christ to his disciples: “In the world
ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer, I have overcome
the world.” An enlightened view was opened to me of the especial
advantages, and deep consolation, derived to the true Christian,
by a firm belief therein: as the expressions evidently carry in
them an earnest to the true believer, of his being likewise enabled
to overcome, as he is faithful in treading in the path of self-denial,
agreeably to his heavenly pattern. The subject opened
to communication, in which the audience were pressingly invited
and encouraged to enter earnestly into this most necessary and
interesting warfare; as nothing short of overcoming the world,
the flesh, and the devil, can restore to us an uninterrupted peace,
and entitle us to the white stone in which the new name is
written; which none can read, but he who hath it.</p>

<p>The succeeding days of this week were attended to as they
passed; but nothing transpired unusual. Our monthly meeting
was on fifth day; and although we had a pretty trying case before
us, yet we got through without interruption, or any breach
of Christian harmony.</p>

<p>First day, the 18th of 9th month. A satisfactory meeting to-day,
more so than for several weeks past; the testimony of truth
went forth freely, and, I think, clothed with a good degree of
power and demonstration of the spirit, which produced a peaceful
and thankful mind. The rest of this week I was closely engaged
in preparing my fallow ground, and sowing my wheat and rye.
I am willing to do my part carefully and industriously; and then
I can with more confidence, place my trust and dependence on a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[Pg 190]</span>
gracious and beneficent Providence, for a blessing on my labour:
for if care and industry be wanting, there is nothing for him to
bless.</p>

<p>First day, the 25th. A silent meeting to-day, as to any vocal
communication; but my mind was too much intruded upon by
unprofitable thoughts, and interrupted by the unchristian commotions
and din of war, which are at present mightily prevailing
in our land, and by the frequent reports of blood and slaughter
witnessed among professed human rational beings: but alas!
how inhuman and irrational do they prove and proclaim themselves
to be, who can deliberately imbrue their hands in each
other’s blood for this world’s honours and profits; and dare at the
same time to call themselves Christians, although so utterly
estranged from the real Christian spirit and life.</p>

<p>The remaining part of this week spent in my usual vocations.</p>

<p>First day, the 2d of 10th month. I was led, in my communication
to-day, to show the unreasonableness of some people, in
looking to, and depending on, being made Christians, by the ministration
of men, and information derived from books and writings;
when, alas, the ministration of angels would be entirely insufficient
for that purpose. The ministration of the <i>Son and sent of God</i>,
even the <i>divine word</i> that was in the beginning with God, and
was God, is only sufficient to effect that great and blessed end:
and that, not by any thing which he has <i>spoken, commanded,
or done without us</i>, but by what he <i>speaks, commands, and
does within us</i>; we yielding and submitting thereto by faithful
obedience. For there is no other way by which any have been,
or can be, made real Christians, or true, sincere, sensible followers
of Christ, in spirit and life.</p>

<p>Nothing unusual transpired in the course of the remaining
part of this week.</p>

<p>First day, the 9th. Whilst sitting in our meeting to-day, there
was brought to my remembrance the following portion of Paul’s
exhortation to his son Timothy, as recorded in his first epistle:
“For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable
unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of
that which is to come. This is a faithful saying and worthy of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[Pg 191]</span>
all acceptation. For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach,
because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all
men, especially of those that believe.” The subject spread, and
my mind was opened to take an enlightened, and enlarged view
thereof; so as to be induced to believe that a necessity was laid
upon me to communicate it to the assembly; and as I yielded
thereto, it still enlarged, and led to an open field of doctrine. I
was clothed with gospel authority, which produced a most precious
solemnity and calm over the meeting. It was evidently the
Lord’s doing, and it was marvellous in my eyes; and my spirit
was made thankful for the renewed, and unmerited mercy and
favour.</p>

<p>Second and third days. Were spent in attending our meeting
for sufferings, at which information was received, through one
of its corresponding members, that the Legislature of our state,
now sitting, were about forming a bill to lay a heavy tax on the
members of our society, to be paid in lieu of personal military
service; which, if passed into a law, would be likely to expose
many of our members to severe suffering. The subject brought
considerable exercise over the meeting, which led into a discussion
of our testimony against war; in which it appeared manifest,
that the deficiency of many of our members, in regard to a
right support thereof, tended to obstruct, in a very considerable
degree, our stepping forward, consistently with the nature of
our appointment, to seek redress therein: nevertheless, after a
considerable time spent thereon, and many different prospects
opened, the meeting so far agreed, as to separate a committee of
six Friends, to pay especial attention to the subject: who were
directed to proceed therein, as the necessity of the case might
require, and way should open for.</p>

<p>Fourth day. Spent in assisting two of my neighbours to settle
their business; and wrote a <i>will</i> for each of them. This is a
business that every man ought to attend to, and complete, in
time of health.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended our preparative meeting, and it being
the one preceding our quarterly meeting, the queries were to be
answered. As one of the overseers was likely to be necessarily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[Pg 192]</span>
absent from the preparative meeting, they met a day or two previous
thereto, and prepared essays of answers; and the one who
attended, produced them to the meeting at the time of entering
upon reading and answering the queries. As I had long
believed, from observation and experience, that this method was
inconsistent with the nature of our profession, and right order of
our discipline, as well as in its tendency very hurtful and weakening
to the meeting, my mind was very much exercised on the
occasion; and the more so, in finding several Friends willing to
adopt the practice: but, after the matter had been pretty fully
spoken to, under a weight of concern, Friends agreed to lay the
essays aside, and not notice them; which was a considerable relief
to my mind.</p>

<p>Sixth and seventh days. Passed without any thing particular
to notice.</p>

<p>First day, the 16th. My mind was brought under a renewed
exercise in our meeting, from a view and consideration of the
very small improvement and progress made by a great portion
of our society in religious experience, when compared with the
opportunities they were so abundantly favoured with from time
to time. It led to a communication on the subject, which was
introduced by a revival of Paul’s reprehension of the Hebrews:
“For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need
that one teach you again which be the first principles of the
oracles of God: and are become such as have need of milk, and
not of strong meat.” The subject spread, and brought a solemn
weight over the meeting, and Friends were pressingly excited to
greater diligence in the right improvement of their precious time;
that so when the day of solemn inquisition comes, they may be
prepared to give in their account with joy, and receive the desired
and peaceful answer of: “well done thou good and faithful
servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make
thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy
Lord.”</p>

<p>Our monthly meeting was held on fifth day; and, I think, the
business was well and harmoniously conducted. The rest of
the week I was busily employed in my usual vocations; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[Pg 193]</span>
divers things occurred, which induced gratitude and thankfulness
of heart to the blessed Author of all our mercies.</p>

<p>First day, the 23d. A silent meeting to-day. What a precious
thing it is, to be taught to know when to speak, and when
to be silent.</p>

<p>Our quarterly meeting was held this week at Flushing. It
was, I think, through the several sittings, a searching, instructive,
favoured season. In the meeting of Ministers and Elders, and
meeting for discipline, many of the hidden things of Esau, or the
first nature, were searched out and made manifest; and their
inconsistency with the gospel dispensation, and hurtful tendency,
exposed; particularly that of coveting and grasping after riches;
to obtain which, many of the members of our society had launched
into extensive business, more particularly in the line of commerce,
and, in order to carry it on, had involved themselves in debt beyond
their ability to pay; and, to keep up a false credit, had, by
a show of friendship, and a deceptive appearance of having great
possessions, drawn in others to lend them money, and become
their sureties for large sums; until both the borrower and lender
were involved in utter ruin, to the great scandal of themselves,
the distress of their families, and reproach of our holy profession.
Others there were, who, for want of keeping close to the foundation
principle of our profession, the inward divine light, and faithful
testimony-bearer in the heart and conscience, had given way
to busy themselves, and take a part in, the political disputes
and controversies among the people, relative to the governments
of this world; which at this time ran high, and had produced
war and distress in the land; by which, they not only grieved
their concerned Friends, but brought much reproach upon themselves
and their profession. My mind was deeply exercised on
account of these things; and I was constrained to bear a full and
faithful testimony against all such inconsistent and unchristian
conduct; and to call Friends’ attention to the necessity of a
more close adherence to the internal principle of divine light and
truth, as the only sure Director and Preserver, in times of trial.</p>

<p>The closing meeting, held for worship, was eminently favoured
with the Divine presence; and the concurring testimo<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[Pg 194]</span>nies
borne, gave evidence of his presiding power; and his great
name was supplicated, and gratitude and thanksgiving were
rendered to him for his continued mercy.</p>

<p>First day, the 30th. In the forepart of our meeting to-day,
my mind seemed clothed with great weakness, and much interrupted
by the continued succession of unnecessary and unprofitable
thoughts: but as I continued to endeavour to draw my
attention from them, although to little effect, till towards the close
of the meeting, my mind was unexpectedly arrested with a
subject very interesting to every immortal soul, that of coming to
believe in, and become settled on, the eternal and unchangeable
rock of salvation, <i>Christ the divine light</i>, as prophesied of, not
only as “a light to lighten the Gentiles,” but to be God’s salvation
to the ends of the earth. The subject spread, accompanied
with life; which, as communicated under the influence thereof,
spread over the meeting, and it became a comfortable refreshing
season. It was evidently the Lord’s doing, and worthy of thankful
acknowledgment, for the unmerited mercy.</p>

<p>Second, third, and fourth days. Busily employed with my
workmen, assisting them in securing our corn, &amp;c. It was a
bountiful crop, which made the labour pleasant, and the heart
thankful.</p>

<p>Fifth day. At our meeting to-day, which was larger than
usual, occasioned by the marriage of one of my daughters, I was
led to set forth, by public testimony, the excellency of the divine
fear, and its blessed and salutary effects on the minds of those,
who live daily under an humbling sense thereof; and, by the
persuasive language of entreaty, endeavoured to arrest the minds
of the tender and beloved youth present, with a sense of the
necessity of having it to dwell richly in their hearts, as the only
sure means of preservation, from the many evils and temptations
which abound in the world. A comfortable calm was brought
over the meeting, a fit preparative for the quiet and orderly
accomplishment of the intended marriage. It was cause of
thankfulness to my mind, having been favoured to have four
daughters, out of five, agreeably married, in the comely order of
Friends: the other, yet single, a tender precious young woman,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[Pg 195]</span>
observing with pious submission her parents’ counsel. But this
is a blessing which few parents enjoy, except those who live
under a daily concern, with timely and continued care, to watch
over and nurture their tender offspring in the fear of the Lord.</p>

<p>Sixth day. Accompanied our daughter with her husband to
his father’s house, and returned in the evening.</p>

<p>Seventh day. Spent in my family cares, and ended the week
with a peaceful mind.</p>

<p>First day, the 6th of 11th month. My lot was silence to-day.
A pleasant lot indeed, when the Master wills it so.</p>

<p>Second, third, and fourth days. Employed diligently in my
ordinary affairs. The rest of the week was devoted to religious
concerns. We had the company of a ministering Friend from
West Jersey on fifth day at our meeting, through whose fervent
labour the life was raised into dominion; which made it a comfortable
and instructive season. Accompanied him the two following
days to Bethpage and Jerusalem, having a meeting at
each place; both of which were seasons of favour.</p>

<p>First day, 13th. Passed our meeting again in silence, under
the comfortable feelings of a mind resigned either to speak or to
be silent.</p>

<p>Second, third, and fourth days. Spent in my usual concerns.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Was our monthly meeting, at which we had the
company of the same Friend, who attended our meeting the
fifth day preceding. I had near unity with him in his exercise;
and had to bear a corresponding testimony, both in the men’s
and women’s meeting. It was a season of favour; and much
suitable counsel was administered, tending to excite Friends to
greater faithfulness and circumspection in the right ordering of
their families, and in bringing up and educating their children,
in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, consistent with our
holy profession.</p>

<p>Sixth and seventh days. Returned, as respects the mind, like
Mordecai to the king’s gate; while my hands were busily employed
in my family affairs.</p>

<p>First day, the 20th. Having felt my mind for some time
increasingly inclined to sit with Friends in their meeting at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[Pg 196]</span>
Martinicock, I thought it right at this time to attend thereto; but
when I came there, my mind felt so vacant and void of concern,
that for some time I was ready to conclude, that if my coming
was of any use, it would all be included in my personal presence,
as an example of silence: but after a time of quiet waiting, a
subject presented, and the life rose with it, and opened to a large
communication, in which the gospel was preached in the demonstration
of the spirit, and with such power attending as produced
a very solemn covering over the meeting; and many hearts
present were broken and contrited. For this favour my mind
was clothed with gratitude and thanksgiving to the bountiful
Author of all our mercies and blessings, “who is over all, God
blessed for ever.”</p>

<p>The rest of this week I spent about home, mostly employed
in my temporal concerns. Passed our fifth day meeting in
silence; and the week ended with a peaceful mind, which I
account an unmerited favour.</p>

<p>First day, the 27th. Feeling my mind drawn to sit with
Friends at Westbury, I accordingly attended their meeting, in
which I was led to set forth the excellency of the state described
by the apostle Paul, which is freed from condemnation, and is
effected by a full submission and obedience to the law of the
spirit of life in Christ Jesus, which sets free from the law of sin
and death. It was an open, and, I trust, a profitable opportunity
to some present; and I felt peace in my labour.</p>

<p>Second day. Attended the funeral of a neighbour, whose
wife was a member of our society; and, although he had been a
very intemperate man, yet, towards his close, he signified a
desire to be laid in Friends’ burial ground, which was allowed.
His widow being desirous I should attend the funeral, I went
accordingly with several other Friends. The neighbourhood
was chiefly Dutch people, and a considerable number attended.
We had a solemn opportunity among them: the testimony borne
had a very reaching effect on many, especially among the youth;
and I was made thankful for the opportunity.</p>

<p>Third and fourth days. Occupied in laying in my winter
store of provisions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[Pg 197]</span></p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended our meeting. It was a quiet encouraging
season. Towards the latter part, I was concerned to show to
Friends the hurtful tendency of evil thinking, which I introduced
by that short saying: Evil be to him, that evil thinks. The
subject enlarged, and spread increased weight over the meeting;
and many minds were humbled and contrited; and we parted
under the solemn covering.</p>

<p>Sixth and seventh days. Occupied in my usual concerns,
with attendant peace of mind.</p>

<p>First day, the 4th of 12th month. A quiet silent meeting
to-day.</p>

<p>Second, third, and fourth days. Diversely engaged. Part of
the time occupied with many other Friends, in collecting some
relief for the poor in the city of New-York; the present tumultuous
state of public affairs having reduced many of the labouring
part of the citizens to a suffering state, for want of the necessaries
of life.</p>

<p>Fifth day. In the meeting for worship which preceded our
preparative meeting, I felt my mind renewedly engaged to call
Friends’ attention to a faithful support of our Christian testimonies;
particularly those against war and injustice; and that all
might with firmness maintain our Christian liberties, without
fear, favour, or affection, against every encroachment of the secular
powers; as, in the present disturbed state of public affairs,
laws had recently been enacted, levying taxes and other requisitions
for the support of war; which was now spreading and
making its destructive ravages in our once peaceful land. A
solemn weight covered the meeting during the communication;
and I was favoured to relieve my mind for the present, from the
weight of concern and exercise it lay under on those accounts.</p>

<p>Sixth and seventh days. Busily engaged in my family concerns;
believing with the apostle, that he who doth not take the
necessary care for his own, and families’ comfortable support,
may be considered to have denied the faith, and in that respect
is worse than an infidel.</p>

<p>First day, the 11th. Being invited to attend the funeral of a
woman attached to Friends, though not a member; a widow of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[Pg 198]</span>
my acquaintance in our neighbouring town of Hempstead; and
feeling an inclination thereto, I attended accordingly. There was
a considerable collection, mostly made up of Episcopalians, Presbyterians,
and Methodists; among whom my mind was enlarged
in gospel love, and led to sound forth the glad tidings of life and
salvation, through Jesus Christ the second Adam, the Lord from
heaven, a quickening spirit; showing that by a full submission
to the inward operation of this spirit, a manifestation of which is
given to every man to profit withal, we experience the truth of
that remarkable saying of the apostle Paul: For as in Adam, or
the first fallen nature, all die; so in Christ, the second Adam, or
the renewed and quickened state, all are made alive; and therefore
born again, not of corruptible seed, but of the incorruptible
seed and word of God, that liveth and abideth for ever. It was a
highly favoured season, in which the Lord’s power was exalted,
and the truth reigned over all, bowing the assembly generally;
and many hearts were broken and contrited. It was evidently
the Lord’s doing, and marvellous in mine eyes; and engaged
renewed gratitude and thankfulness of heart for the unmerited
mercy.</p>

<p>Second and third days. Spent in attending our meeting for
sufferings in New-York, in which an opportunity opened to relieve
my mind of a concern I had been for some time exercised
under, on account of some recent laws enacted by the general
government of this country, and the legislature of the state of New-York;
which, in their tendency, were opposite to our testimony
against war and injustice; and were likely to produce much suffering
to the faithful in our society, who saw they could not yield to
the requisition of those laws, without balking their Christian testimonies
in these respects. I was led to excite Friends to unity in
this concern; as the want of uniformity would very much tend to
lay waste those precious testimonies, and increase the sufferings
of the society.</p>

<p>Fourth day. Attended our neighbouring monthly meeting of
Westbury. My mind was engaged to call Friends’ attention to
a more close adherence to discipline; the right management of
which could not be profitably effected, without keeping to a right<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[Pg 199]</span>
and sound form. I felt satisfaction in my labour, in a belief
that the honest-hearted were strengthened and encouraged.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended our own monthly meeting, at which we
had the company of our friend John Winslow, from the district
of Maine, in New England. His gospel labours, in the line of
the ministry, were acceptable and edifying. At this meeting, I
opened to my friends a prospect, which had for some time attended
my mind to make a visit to some scattered families of our society,
who resided in the outskirts of our quarterly meeting; some of
whom, being distant from meeting, but seldom attended. I had
also a view of visiting some families who were not members, and
of appointing some meetings, among some of the neighbouring
inhabitants of other societies. The meeting united with the
prospect, and left me at liberty to pursue it, as way might open.</p>

<p>On sixth and seventh days, I accompanied our friend John
Winslow to Bethpage and Jerusalem; attending a meeting in
each place. The Lord our gracious helper was near, strengthening
and qualifying to preach the gospel of life and salvation in
the clear demonstration of the spirit, and with power; humbling
and contriting many present, and rejoicing the minds of the
honest-hearted.</p>

<p>First day, the 18th. I attended our own meeting; and was
favoured therein with a lively impressive testimony which produced
a very comfortable solemnity over the meeting, and rendered
it an instructive edifying season.</p>

<p>On second day, by appointment, I met our friend John Winslow
at a meeting in the town of Oysterbay; where we again
witnessed the Shepherd of Israel to be near, enabling us to discharge
ourselves faithfully to the people; setting the truth above
errour, and left it upon them, whether they will hear, or forbear.</p>

<p>On third day evening, had an appointed meeting for the black
people in our meeting-house at Jericho. It appeared to be
owned in a very especial manner by the Master of our assemblies,
who furnished doctrine suited to their states and conditions; and
the truth reigned over all, fully evidencing that the Lord our
God is no respecter of persons, but is gracious and merciful
unto all; and that in every nation, kindred, tongue, and peo<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[Pg 200]</span>ple,
those that fear him, and work righteousness, are accepted of
him.</p>

<p>Fourth day. Attended an appointed meeting, about four miles
easterly from Jericho. It was a highly favoured season; most
present were affected by the prevalence of truth, that ran as oil.
Surely it was the Lord’s doing, and worthy of grateful acknowledgments
and thanksgiving, for the unmerited favour.</p>

<p>In the evening we attended another meeting at Cold Spring;
and although not so open as the former, yet we were favoured to
clear ourselves among them; and left them with the reward of
peace in our labour.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended a meeting in the morning at the house
of a man not a member, at Huntington West Neck; and in the
evening one at the west end of the town of Huntington, at Peleg
Woods’. The first was a very precious season to the visiters, and,
I trust also, to most or all of the visited: the latter a stripping
time in the forepart, but ended well.</p>

<p>Sixth day. Visited some families on our way home, which
visits, I believe, were mutually comfortable.</p>

<p>Seventh day. Spent partly in repairing the travelling vehicle
of our friend aforenamed, who had accompanied me in the above
tour.</p>

<p>First day, the 25th. My mind, while sitting in our meeting,
was opened on the subject of faith, in the revival of that Scripture
passage, viz: “All men have not faith.” I was led, in a clear
full testimony, to show to the auditory, why all men have not
faith; although the means of obtaining it are freely offered to
the acceptance of all; yet it is not to be obtained by man’s natural
wisdom or acquirements, but only by and through the operation
and inspiration of the grace and spirit of God, as man yields in
obedience and submission thereunto: hence he comes to know
God, by the inward experimental touches of his own life and
power in his soul; and hence springs up in him, as he patiently
submits thereunto, that living operative faith, that works by love
to the purifying of the heart; but such as are exercising themselves
in their own speculative wisdom, and refuse submission to
the manifestations of divine grace, have not faith, because they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[Pg 201]</span>
reject the only means by which it can be obtained. The truth
was raised into dominion, to the praise of him who is over all, God
blessed for ever.</p>

<p>Second and third days. Busily employed in my husbandry
and family affairs; each day closing with a peaceful mind.</p>

<p>Fourth and fifth days. I attended the meetings at Westbury
and Cowneck; and previous notice being given of my intention
of attending them, they were larger than usual at that time in
the week. Through the gracious condescension of Israel’s never-failing
Helper, my mind was opened to declare to the people of
the things concerning the kingdom of God, in two large doctrinal
testimonies, one at each place, suited to the states of the auditories.
The doctrines delivered distilled as the dew on the minds
of many who were present; causing tears of contrition to trickle
down their cheeks. Surely such seasons are as a brook by the way
to the honest exercised traveller Zion-ward; as they tend to an
increase of faith, and inspire with fresh courage to persevere in
the heavenly journey.</p>

<p>I also attended an appointed meeting in the intermediate evening
at Hempstead Harbour. Although I was led in my communication
to treat in a full clear manner divers particular doctrines
of the gospel: yet it seemed to have but little entrance in
the minds of those present, which made the exercise arduous,
and afforded but little satisfaction in the end. This I have found
mostly to be the case, in neighbourhoods where the minds of the
people are led to adhere to outward, formal and ceremonial performances
in religion; and especially where much self-activity
and bodily exercise is superadded, which is very much the case
with the principal part of this neighbourhood: and those not of
this description are, except a few, in a state of lukewarmness and
almost entire indifferency, respecting those things which belong
to their soul’s salvation.</p>

<p>On sixth day, I attended the funeral of a person who died in a
Friend’s family, wherein he had been a labourer for many years,
in the neighbourhood last mentioned. Although but few collected,
yet the opportunity was solemn; and the testimony borne had
a reaching effect on the minds of divers present especially on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[Pg 202]</span>
several of the youth. May it be fastened by the Master of assemblies,
as a nail in a sure place.</p>

<p>Seventh day. Occupied in my temporal concerns; and the
week, and the year, ended with a peaceful mind.</p>

<p>First day, the 1st of 1st month, 1815. My mind, while silently
waiting in our meeting, was opened to view in prospect the
beauty and excellency of order. As it spread on my mind, I felt
constrained to communicate on the subject; and to show, that all
things, which continued in full subjection to the divine will, were
preserved in the same beautiful order they were arranged in
from the beginning; and that all disorder sprang from, and was
the effect of, a will separate and distinct from the divine will.
For as God is a God of order, and is also the creator of all things,
of course there can be no order and right harmony in his creation,
but what he is the sole author of: hence the necessity of
every created being becoming wholly subject to his heavenly and
divine will, as nothing else can possibly restore the creation to its
primitive order and harmony: and when this is effected, there will
be a perfect subjection of every distinct and separate will, to the will
of our heavenly Father. Then the whole creation will stand in
a state of subservience to the divine will; then will the morning
stars again resume their song, and all the sons of God shout for
joy. O! happy day, may the Lord hasten it in his own time.</p>

<p>Second day. I attended the funeral of a young man, who
was killed by the falling of his horse. He was in company with
a number of loose young men at a tavern, where they had been
running horses; and his horse threw him off in a fearful manner;
nevertheless he escaped unhurt: but shortly after, as he
was riding from the tavern, his horse fell with him, and he died
with the hurt he received by the fall, in about a week after. The
accident had considerable effect on his young companions; and
impressed their minds with sadness and alarm. They were
generally present at his funeral; as also were most of the youth
in the neighbourhood, for a considerable distance round; who,
with others of riper years, made a large collection. The Lord,
who is always graciously near, and ready to help in every needful
time, opened my mouth among them in a large affecting testi<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[Pg 203]</span>mony,
suiting the occasion. It was a very humbling solemn season,
not soon to be forgotten by many present; and my spirit
was made thankful for the unmerited favour.</p>

<p>After the funeral, I went, with my wife and daughter Elizabeth,
to Islip, to see our grandson, who is in a weakly declining
state. We returned home the next evening.</p>

<p>Fourth day. Engaged in my family concerns.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended our meeting to-day in silence. We had
the company of our friend Phebe I. Merritt, from New-York,
who also sat most of the meeting in silence; but appeared
towards the close in a short testimony, which spread a good
degree of life over the meeting; which was truly gladdening.</p>

<p>Sixth and seventh days. Part of the time occupied in temporal
concerns; and part in assisting an ancient Friend, upwards
of ninety years of age, in settling his business, and writing his
will. He appeared competent to the purpose, both as to memory
and understanding.</p>

<p>First day, the 8th. My mind was in unison with the exercise
and testimony of our friend Phebe I. Merritt, who was again
with us at our meeting to-day; and I found it my duty towards
the close of the meeting to set my seal thereto, in a short impressive
testimony: and, I trust, the meeting closed under a sensible
degree of divine favour, worthy of our thankfulness and gratitude.</p>

<p>Second and third days. While my hands were busily employed
in my temporal business, my mind was often led to rise
above all temporal enjoyments; and to contemplate on things of
an eternal nature. In the course of my meditations I was led to
contrast those who are <i>led and influenced</i> by the wisdom and
will of man, with those who are <i>led and influenced</i> by the
wisdom and will of God; and it was opened to me that, of
necessity, the former must be <i>ruled and governed</i> by the
wisdom and power of man: hence the necessity of coercion, and
hence the necessity of war; as every government of coercion,
must of necessity be set up and maintained by the force and
fear of the sword, as that is the last alternative, in every government,
set up in the wisdom and will of man. But those, who
are <i>led and influenced</i> by the wisdom and will of God, have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[Pg 204]</span>
no necessity of being governed by any thing else than the
divine wisdom and will, through the power of persuasive
love; and no other coercion can ever be necessary in the kingdom
of heaven, where nothing reigns but love, peace, and joy
undefiled, without intermission. And O! that every rational
being was so inspired with a real soul-craving desire, after the
enjoyment of this heavenly and peaceful kingdom, as not to rest
until he had gained a satisfactory assurance, that his name was
enrolled in that city, which hath foundations whose builder and
maker the Lord is.</p>

<p>Fourth day. I rode to New-York, in order to attend the funeral
of our beloved friend, Matthew Franklin, to take place the next
day. He was taken with an apoplectic fit while speaking in the
morning meeting in Pearl-street, on the preceding first day. He
appeared lively in testimony, but was suddenly stopped by indisposition,
and sat quietly down: but soon arose and withdrew,
and was followed by some of his friends, and would have fallen
as soon as he got out, had he not been upheld by them. In a
few minutes he fell into an almost senseless state, as to the body,
not being able to speak afterwards; and quietly expired at about
half past seven in the evening of the following day: and, we
trust, has safely landed in that celestial port, where the wicked
cease from troubling, and the weary soul is at rest.</p>

<p>He appeared amiable in his life and conversation, and was
generally beloved by his friends and acquaintance, especially the
youth; for whose improvement and preservation, he often appeared
very solicitous. The unusually large attendance at his
funeral, and the solemnity that appeared in the countenances of
the multitude assembled, (the meeting-house though large not
containing perhaps more than two-thirds of those that gathered,)
carried full evidence of the correctness of the foregoing representation,
as did also the testimonies borne on that solemn occasion.</p>

<p>I attended, besides the funeral on fifth day, two other meetings;
one at Liberty-street in the morning, it being Friends’ meeting
day at that place, and a meeting for the people of colour in Pearl-street.
The latter was very large. My mouth was opened in
each assembly to speak of those things which relate to the king<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[Pg 205]</span>dom
of God, especially at the funeral; and in the meeting for the
people of colour, my mind was largely opened to preach the gospel
in the demonstration of the spirit, and the Lord’s power attended,
humbling and solemnizing the assemblies. It was evidently the
Lord’s doing. May all the honour and praise be ascribed to him,
for he only is worthy, both now and for ever. Lie low, O my soul!
and be humbled in the dust, from a due sense of such unmerited
mercy.</p>

<p>On sixth day, I rode to Manhattanville, and attended a meeting
there in the evening. It was for the most part, I think, a
favoured season. The truth was largely declared, and appeared
to have a reaching effect upon most present.</p>

<p>Seventh day. Returned to the city, and attended a meeting
in the evening in the Bowery; which I had appointed the day
before I left town. It was a very solemn quiet meeting, the
power of truth flowed freely, and I hope had a profitable entrance
with some. May it prove as a nail, fastened in a sure place.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</h2>


<p class="chap-head">Visit to families of Friends in New-York, and engagements at and about
home, 1815.</p>


<p>First day, the 15th of 1st month, 1815. I attended Friends’
meetings in New-York. Was at Pearl-street in the morning,
and the other in the afternoon. My mind was opened to communicate
largely in both meetings; and was led, in the course of the
testimonies, to open divers particular doctrines of the gospel; and
to distinguish between the law state, and that of the gospel; and
to show to the people, that as all the shadows of the law stood in,
and consisted of, outward and elementary things, they must end
in the gospel, which is the substance of all shadows; and of
course supercedes them all. It was a day of favour, in which
the Lord’s power was exalted; and his name and truth set above
all errour and untruth.</p>

<p>On second day evening I attended the meeting for sufferings,
which was adjourned to that time on a particular occasion. We
sat again the next day, when we finished the business before
us. In the evening I attended a meeting I had appointed for
the labouring class of the community, and for those in low circumstances.
The weather was very inclement; it being a snow
storm; which prevented most of the women from attending: but
there was a considerable number of men, who behaved with
great order and solemnity. They received, with much attention,
the truths delivered: which inspired a hope, that the opportunity
would be blest, and a real benefit experienced by many of them.</p>

<p>Fourth day. I attended Friends’ meeting in Pearl-street,
which proved a comfortable, and, I believe, instructive season to
some, especially among the youth. After this, I returned home<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[Pg 207]</span>
with peace of mind, and a thankful sense of the continued mercy
of a gracious God to his creature man, amidst all his backslidings
and transgressions.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended our own monthly meeting; in which I
had to lay before Friends the great advantage that would result,
not only to us as individuals, but also to society, by individual
faithfulness, and a full belief and trust in the divine providence;
and a strict and undeviating adherence to the order and discipline
of the Church, for which labour I had peace.</p>

<p>Sixth day. I attended the funeral of Charles Valentine, son
of David Valentine, at Moscheto Cove. It was very largely
attended by Friends and others. I had an open time among
them; which was introduced with this scripture exhortation:
“Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made
us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.”
The subject was largely opened, showing that all the works of
the flesh did in a lesser or greater degree bring the mind under
a yoke of bondage; and that the fear of death was a principal
one, out of which many others originated; such as every means
of self defence, that consisted in war and warlike preparations.
Every ceremonial performance in matters of a religious nature;
such as water baptism, and what is called the ordinance of the
supper, in the use of outward bread and wine, not being essential
bring a yoke and burden on the believer in Christ; as <i>he</i> came
purposely to set his followers free from all signs and shadows,
and bring them into the possession and enjoyment of the substance;
whereby we come to know all the shadows to flee away
and come to an end; as <i>Christ manifested</i>, is the <i>substance</i>
and end of all shadows. It was a highly favoured season. The
truth was raised into dominion and ran freely, humbling and
contriting many hearts. May the praise, the honour, and the
glory be all ascribed to Him, who opens and none can shut, and
who shuts and none can open; and who remains to be “God
over all, blessed for ever.”</p>

<p>Seventh day. Attended to some necessary repairs about my
farm and tenements. For as I am much from home attending
to my religious engagements, when I feel a liberty to be at home,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[Pg 208]</span>
I find it needful to be industriously employed, to keep my temporal
concerns in order; so that when I leave home on truth’s
account, my mind may be at liberty, without thinking much
about them.</p>

<p>First day. Attended our own meeting, mostly in silence.
The rest of this week was principally taken up in preparing for
and attending our quarterly meeting, which was held at Westbury.
It was pretty largely attended, both the meeting for discipline,
and that for public worship; the latter was somewhat hurt
by an unskilful appearance in the ministry, in the forepart, but
ended well. In the meeting of Ministers and Elders, as also in
that for discipline, a living exercise and concern were prevalent
with divers Friends, not only in searching out the causes of the
numerous weaknesses and deficiencies that were manifest in
society, but also endeavouring for their removal, by much tender
and pressing advice and counsel, suited to the states of those who
were delinquent. Many minds were brought under an humbling
exercise and travail of spirit in those solemn opportunities; and
divers young Friends, who were under the forming hand, preparing
for usefulness in the Church, came forth at this time, and
publicly espoused the cause of truth and righteousness, uniting
with their elder brethren in the exercise and travail which were
felt to prevail in those favoured meetings. My spirit was led
into near sympathy with these, and fervent was the desire and
prayer of my mind for their preservation in the path of duty;
that so they might grow up and become useful in society, and
faithful labourers and pillars in the Lord’s house, that should go
no more out.</p>

<p>First day, the 29th. We had a comfortable meeting to-day,
mostly in quiet silent retirement; except towards the close my
mind was quickened and opened to a short communication, in the
remembrance of the case of Joseph and his brethren; wherein I
was led to recapitulate their envy and hatred towards him, and
to show that their wicked intentions in selling him, to prevent
his rising to the power and dignity which his dreams appeared to
forbode, were the very means in the ordering of divine providence
of accomplishing their fulfilment; and of course made their bow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[Pg 209]</span>ing
and making their obeisance to him much more humiliating
than it would have been had they conducted themselves towards
him in the line of true brotherhood, and had he been raised to
the dignity and power he was, by some other way. But herein
was the true proverb verified: Let envy alone, and it will
punish itself. I was led further to open the malignity and baneful
effects of those hateful, and very evil propensities. A solemn
weight covered the meeting; and we parted under a thankful
sense of the favour.</p>

<p>The rest of this week I spent in my ordinary vocations, and
in visiting some friends under bodily affliction.</p>

<p>First day, the 5th of 2d month. I left home in order to proceed
again in the concern I had engaged in, to visit some of the
inhabitants in some of our neighbouring towns, and some scattered
families of Friends and others. I spent the week in this service,
and attended nine meetings, all by appointment in places
where no meetings are held except one; and visited eleven
families of Friends, and persons not members. Although I
left home under much depression of spirit, attended with great
discouragement, insomuch that I was brought near to a conclusion
that it would be safest to tarry at home, and wait for
a more full manifestation; yet, as I brought the subject to the
test in my own mind, and patiently waited for an answer in
much abasedness and humiliation, a small degree of light
sprang up, in which the voice said, go and trust in the Lord to
open the way. My mind was then centered in a state of perfect
acquiescence; and I proceeded accordingly, seeing nothing further
when I left home, than to attend the meeting of Friends at
Bethpage. This was the first I attended; but before the close
of that meeting, light sprang up, and the way in which I should
advance clearly opened; and as my trust and dependence were
fixed in the arm of divine sufficiency, strength and ability were
furnished from season to season, faithfully to espouse the cause
of truth and righteousness, and to preach the gospel in the clear
demonstration of the spirit, and with power; convincing and
contriting many minds, and relieving and comforting my own.
My heart was inspired with continual thankfulness and gratitude<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[Pg 210]</span>
to the blessed Author of all our mercies. I returned home on
seventh day evening, accompanied with true peace of mind.</p>

<p>First day, 12th. Attended our own meeting; and after a
pretty long season of solemn silence, my mind was opened to
communication, in the revival of the following declaration of the
apostle James: “For as the body without the spirit is dead, so
faith without works is dead also.” The subject was largely and
impressively opened, which brought a solemn covering over the
meeting, and made it a season of comfort and edification. Surely
such seasons administer cause for all the humble and contrite in
heart to thank God and take courage; and press forward in the
holy and heavenly way.</p>

<p>Second day. I found liberty to occupy this day in my temporal
concerns.</p>

<p>Third day. I attended the funeral of a man, not a member,
at Jerusalem. There was a very large collection of people, composed
of the different classes of civil society; and although it was
a time of extreme cold, and the means for rendering the rooms,
wherein the people assembled, comfortable, very inadequate for
that end, yet they were generally very quiet and orderly, and
appeared to pay great attention to the doctrines delivered. My
heart and mouth were opened among them, to speak of the
things concerning the kingdom of heaven, and to set forth, in a
clear and forcible manner, the way and means of man’s <span class="correction" title="In the original book: salvavation">salvation</span>;
and that nothing short of a freedom from sin, and the
experience of real righteousness, would be sufficient to effect that
great and happy end.</p>

<p>Fourth day. I attended the monthly meeting at Westbury;
and had some close searching exercise, both in the meeting for
worship and that for discipline, tending to quicken Friends’ minds
to a more lively concern for the arising of the divine life in their
meetings; that so their faith might be productive of good works;
and they qualified to serve the Lord in newness of life, and not
in the oldness of the letter.</p>

<p>Fifth day. I attended our own monthly meeting. We had
but little business to attend to at this time. I found it incumbent,
before the meeting closed, to submit a prospect that attended my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[Pg 211]</span>
mind to the consideration of the meeting, to visit the families of
Friends of the monthly meeting of New-York; and received
Friends’ united concurrence therein.</p>

<p>Sixth day. I spent with my family, and in my family concerns;
and in the evening attended a meeting I had appointed
at Woolver Hollow, a neighbourhood consisting mostly of Dutch
people. It was a very solemn quiet meeting, and I had good
service among them, to the mutual comfort and edification of
most present.</p>

<p>Seventh day. I left home again on my former concern in
visiting some more of the scattered families of Friends and others,
in the suburbs of our quarterly meeting; having not fully accomplished
that service. Our first meeting was the next day at
Rockaway, among my relatives and acquaintance, this having
been the place of my former residence. Although the meeting
at this time was small, partly occasioned by the inclemency of
the weather, yet, through the gracious extendings of divine love,
it proved a favoured season.</p>

<p>After this, we proceeded eastward on the southern part of the
island, and had five more meetings among those not in membership
with us, except here and there a scattered family, or part of
a family; yet numbers of them appear to be convinced of the
truth of the doctrines and principles of Friends; and many of
them, I believe, if they continue faithful to their convincement,
will in time become members with us. We also had some edifying
seasons in the few scattered families of Friends in this quarter,
and in a number of families of those inclining to Friends.
We returned home on fifth day evening; and I found sweet
peace in thus dedicating myself to the promotion of the cause of
truth and righteousness in the earth.</p>

<p>Sixth and seventh days. Devoted to the care of my family
and household concerns; which I find to be my incumbent duty,
when at liberty from my religious engagements and gospel
services.</p>

<p>First day, the 26th. Attended our own meeting to-day.</p>

<p>Second day. Attended the funeral of a woman not a member;
and the family being inclined to Friends, a meeting was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[Pg 212]</span>
held on the occasion, which proved a profitable edifying opportunity.</p>

<p>Third day. I proceeded to New-York, in order to attend the
monthly meeting the next day; in which I opened my prospect
of visiting the families belonging thereto, with which the meeting
united. But feeling a concern to attend the monthly meeting to
be held at Flushing the following day, before entering on the
family visit, I accordingly went. The meeting for worship,
which preceded that for discipline, was a favoured season, in
which truth reigned. I likewise had a large favoured meeting
with the inhabitants of the town in the evening; and the next
day returned to New-York.</p>

<p>Seventh day, the 4th of 3d month. I began the family visit.
Sat with twelve families, in some of which I felt the renewed
visitation of the heavenly Father’s love, in which the visited and
visiters were united in the bond of Christian fellowship; which
tended to inspire with strength to persevere and trust in the
Lord, who hath graciously promised, that they who trust in him
shall not be confounded: but in others, things were much out
of order, and darkness spread over us at times as a curtain,
when we found it needful to be clothed with faith and patience;
and as these were abode in, after a time of suffering with the
seed, way was mostly made to set the testimony of truth over
darkness and errour. Many were convicted and instructed; and
peace afforded to my own mind. Samuel Parsons kindly accompanied
me in the greater part of the visit; and cordially united
and sympathized with me therein.</p>

<p>First day. I attended the meetings at Liberty-street, both
forenoon and afternoon, and sat with four families; and, in the
course of the week, seventy more. In these we met with a
variety of states and conditions, which renders such services truly
arduous and exercising, requiring great inward attention to the
divine gift; as nothing else can open to the diverse states of the
people, and qualify to speak suitably to their several conditions, to
their improvement and help; and give the answer of peace to
those under such exercises. I also attended Friends’ meetings,
held in the middle of the week, at Pearl and Liberty streets. At<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[Pg 213]</span>
the former was a marriage. It was a time of unusual favour, in
which the descendings of the heavenly Father’s love were felt
to cover the very large assembly, in an eminent manner. My
mouth was opened in a large impressive testimony, in which, in
a clear instructive manner, I had to set forth the great difference
between a believer and an unbeliever; showing that the former
was, by faithfulness and obedience to the inward divine gift of
grace, daily improving and advancing in divine wisdom and
knowledge, and in the enjoyments and consolations always attendant
thereon; while the latter was sinking deeper and deeper into
a state of darkness and errour, and the distresses and vexations,
which naturally result from unbelief. It was a day of high favour,
in which the truth was exalted over all opposition and errour,
rejoicing many minds; and bowing my heart in deep thankfulness
and gratitude to the Author of every blessing. Surely it
was the Lord’s doing; therefore let all the praise be ascribed to
Him who is over all, blessed for ever.</p>

<p>First day, the 12th. Attended Pearl-street meeting in the
forenoon and afternoon. Both meetings were much hurt by a
long, tedious and lifeless communication in each, by a Friend,
not a resident here, who attended those meetings at this time. It
very much shut up my way, and was, I apprehend, a great loss
to the meetings; as it very much hurt the solemnity. In the
course of this week I sat with twenty-nine families; and attended
Pearl-street meeting on fourth day. After this I rode home, in
order to attend our own monthly meeting, and returned on
seventh day to New-York. On first day, I attended Pearl-street
meeting in the forenoon, and Liberty-street in the afternoon,
both comfortable seasons. In the course of this week, I sat with
seventy-seven families.</p>

<p>First day, the 26th. Attended Pearl-street meeting in the
forenoon and afternoon, and an appointed meeting at Liberty-street
in the evening. They were large full meetings; and
through the condescending goodness of Israel’s Shepherd, they
were eminently favoured. My mouth was opened in each, to
preach the gospel in the demonstration of truth, to the comfort,
edification and instruction of many who attended, as appeared by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[Pg 214]</span>
their solemn and satisfactory deportment; and I was truly thankful
that I had been enabled to get through this day’s exercise, to
the peace of my own mind, which I esteem the best treasure.</p>

<p>Second day. Sat with five families in the city, and in the
afternoon crossed the ferry to Brooklyn, and visited three families
of Friends in that neighbourhood, they being members of Liberty-street
meeting. I also had an appointed meeting in the evening,
for the inhabitants of Brooklyn. It was well attended, and proved
an instructive favoured season, gratefully to be remembered.</p>

<p>Third day. Rode to Manhattanville, and visited the families
of Friends in that place, and three families on the way; and
returned to the city next morning, and attended Friends’ preparative
meeting in Pearl-street. It was the time for answering
the queries; and it proved an exercising meeting, Friends having
too generally got in the habit of making use of words which
rendered their answers evasive, and not giving a direct one to
the question; by which the deficient members were very much
covered; and which tended rather to set them at ease, than to
stir them up to more diligence and care. My mind was deeply
exercised, things appearing very much out of order with many
in this city; and the number of the faithful very small. I endeavoured
to discharge myself faithfully among them, and found
peace in my labour.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, I had a select opportunity with the Ministers,
Elders and Overseers. In this opportunity, I, in a good measure,
relieved my mind from a burden I had been under for some
time, respecting Friends in those stations. In the evening I had
an appointed meeting in the east part of the town, principally
among those not in membership with us. It was held in a large,
commodious building, erected for the purpose of educating the
children of such poor people as did not belong to any society of
professed Christians. There was at this time a school held in
it, consisting of nearly four hundred such children. The expenses
were defrayed by the charitable donations of the citizens at large.
It is a benevolent institution, and well conducted. The meeting
was large, consisting, as was supposed, of a thousand people; to
whom the truths of the gospel were largely opened, com<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[Pg 215]</span>forting
and instructing many minds, and administering reproof
to the lukewarm, the licentious, and immoral. A general
solemnity spread over the meeting; and we parted under a deep
and humbling sense of the unmerited favour.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended the preparative meeting at Liberty-street,
which was a comfortable meeting. The queries appeared to be
answered with much more consistency than at the other. The
afternoon and evening spent in the family visit; as also the two
following days.</p>

<p>First day, the 2d of 4th month. I attended Pearl-street meeting
in the morning, and that at Liberty-street in the afternoon;
and public notice being given of my intention of attending the
latter, it was large. I also had an appointed meeting in the
evening at Pearl-street, which was also very large. They were
all seasons of favour, especially those at Pearl-street, wherein
truth reigned, and the people’s minds were solemnized, and the
faithful comforted and made glad together, under a grateful sense
of the continued mercy, and longsuffering loving kindness of
Israel’s Shepherd to the workmanship of his holy hand.</p>

<p>Second day. Sat with four families in the forenoon; and, in
the afternoon, had an appointed meeting at Flatbush, near the
west end of Long Island, where no Friends live. The inhabitants
were mostly Dutch people, the descendants of the ancient
Hollanders: they had but little acquaintance with us or our
principles. The meeting was held in their court-house. A
respectable number collected, and behaved quietly, becoming the
occasion. Our gracious Helper was near, furnishing doctrine
suited to their states and conditions; which had a reaching
and salutary effect upon many minds; and through the prevalence
of the power of truth, which rose into dominion, divers
hearts were broken and contrited. We parted from them with
thankful hearts, and returned to the city that evening.</p>

<p>Third day. Attended the meeting of Ministers and Elders,
composed of the select members of the monthly meetings of New-York
and Flushing. It was a solemn, and, I hope, a profitable
time. The next day the monthly meeting of New-York was
held, in which I was favoured to close my visit to Friends there,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[Pg 216]</span>
in an opportunity with the members generally together, both
male and female, select from others. At this meeting I discharged
myself fully to the peace of my own mind, and, I trust, to the
comfort and encouragement of the faithful; and at the same
time administered reproof and correction to the lukewarm, and
unsound members, and strength to the weak and feeble-minded.
The Lord was supplicated in behalf of his people, that he would
still strive with them, both in mercy and judgment, as he may
see meet, in his matchless wisdom and loving kindness, and not
give his heritage to reproach, lest the people without be led to
inquire, where is their God.</p>

<p>Fifth day. I turned my face homeward, having a meeting at
Newtown Kilns, at the eleventh hour, and another in the town
at evening. They were favoured seasons; although the latter
was somewhat interrupted at the close, by a hireling minister,
of the Presbyterian persuasion, who took some exceptions to the
doctrines delivered respecting water baptism, imputative righteousness,
and the hire of ministers. The arguments he advanced in
support of these appeared very weak, being unfounded and fallacious;
and the scripture passages which he quoted to prove his
positions, were in direct opposition thereto. For his proof of
water baptism, he made use of the doctrine of the apostle Paul;
and especially that part wherein he thanks God that he had
baptized but a very small number, positively asserting, that
Christ sent him not to baptize; therefore, if so great a minister
as Paul had no commission or authority to baptize, that is with
water, who had converted so many to the Christian faith, and
set up and established many churches, in parts where no other
of the primitive ministers had yet travelled, surely he could not
think it needful, or otherwise he must have fallen very far short
of fulfilling his ministry; but if we conclude, as I apprehend we
are all bound to do, that Paul, as he himself asserts, was not a
whit behind the chiefest of the primitive apostles, we may then
safely conclude that water baptism has no part in the commission
of a gospel minister, and consequently is no part of the gospel
dispensation, but was only made use of in condescension to the
weak state of the Jewish believers, in the same way as circum<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[Pg 217]</span>cision
was made use of by Paul. Indeed it is abundantly evident,
that the rituals of the law were continued for many years by
many of the Jewish Christians. It is clear, however, that it was
all in condescension to the weak state that the believers were
in, through the force of tradition and custom. Having been
long in the use of outward shadows and types, the way did not
open to shake them all off at once; but as the light of the glorious
gospel should arise, they would gradually recede and give
place to the substance, just as when the sun rises above the
horizon, all the shadows of the night flee away.</p>

<p>And with regard to imputative righteousness, some Christians
affirm that the righteousness of Christ, wrought without us,
being imputed to believers, they are thereby justified, without any
works of righteousness carried on in us, by and through the
operation of the grace of God, we yielding thereunto, and co-operating
therewith. But the apostle Paul asserts that “the grace
of God, that bringeth salvation, hath appeared to all men, teaching
us, that denying ungodliness, and worldly lusts, we should live
soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world.” Now
will any be so inconsistent with truth and righteousness, as
to assert, that a man is justified merely by the righteousness
that Christ wrought in the outward manifestation, without his
coming to know in his own experience, those works of <span class="correction" title="In the original book: righeousness">righteousness</span>
wrought in him, as above expressed by the apostle; and
which he must be a party to and in, or they cannot be wrought.
For a mere belief in grace does not do the work of righteousness;
but faith in the sufficiency of the grace is the first previous work
of the mind of man; but if that belief is not carried into effect,
such faith cannot save him; for faith without works is dead,
being alone, as a body without the spirit. I think the conclusive
arguments of the apostle James are quite sufficient to prove these
things to every judicious mind. For although the harlot Rahab
had, from what appears, a full belief that Israel’s armies would
conquer the land of Canaan, and it is likely many thousands
more of the Canaanites had the same belief; yet as none of
them added good works to their faith but her, none others
were saved. Abraham also believed he was required to sacri<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[Pg 218]</span>fice
his son, as the scripture assures us; but had he not gone
forward to put it in execution, his faith, instead of being imputed
to him for righteousness, would have greatly administered to his
condemnation; and instead of becoming the friend of God, he
would have been cast out of his favour; so that by his works
only was his faith made perfect.</p>

<p>But the great errour, of the generality of professed Christians,
lies in not making a right distinction between the works that
men do in their own will, and by the leadings of their own carnal
wisdom, and those works that the true believer does, in the
will and wisdom of God. For although the former, let them
consist in what they will, whether in prayers, or preaching, or
any other devotional exercises, are altogether evil: so on the
contrary, those of the latter, let them consist in what they may,
whether in ploughing, in reaping, or in any handicraft labour,
or in any other service, temporal or spiritual, as they will in all
be accompanied with the peace and presence of their heavenly
Father, so all they do, will be righteous, and will be imputed to
them as such. And these, and these only, will witness the blessing
pronounced by the royal psalmist, where he saith: “Blessed
is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. Blessed
is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in
whose spirit there is no guile.” And who are those whom the
royal prophet here designates; why none but such as have carefully
and strictly adhered to the teaching of the grace of God;
and who by its teaching and aid have denied themselves of all
ungodliness, and worldly lusts; and have come to live soberly,
righteously, and godly in this present world.</p>

<p>And in order to prove the consistency of Christian ministers
taking pay, and making contracts with the people for their
preaching, and letting themselves out to the highest bidders, he
brought forward quotations from the same Paul, who is so very
severe against hirelings; showing, both by his example and
precepts, that it is more blessed to give than to receive; and that
parents or leaders ought to care for the children, and not the
children for the parents.</p>

<p>The quotations he brought forward were founded principally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[Pg 219]</span>
on these two passages from the epistle to the Corinthians: “Do
ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of
the things of the temple, and they which wait at the altar are
partakers with the altar? Even so hath the Lord ordained, that
they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.”</p>

<p>In order to understand correctly how far proof will arise from
these passages of scripture, it will be necessary to consider the
ground upon which the priesthood was established under the
law; and likewise the reason and ground, upon which their
maintenance was instituted: for it was all a work of perfect wisdom.
And first, the dispensation of the law was outward and
local; so likewise was the priesthood: none being eligible to that
office but the family of Levi: and in consequence of their being
appointed to that office, they were deprived of having their portion
or allotment in the land; but the Lord was to be their portion:
except that they were to have room for residence, and some
suburbs about their dwellings, for their convenience. Their
office was to kill and prepare the sacrifices which the people
brought of their holy things, as offerings to the Lord; so that
they were under the necessity of doing a great deal of manual
labour for the people. Therefore, in order that they might have
a livelihood among their brethren, the Lord had let one-twelfth,
that is Levi’s lot, to farm among his brethren; and they were
bound to return to their brethren, the Levites, one-tenth of their
increase; to reward them not only for the abundant manual
labour they were bound to do for them, but also in consideration
of their having the improvement and profits arising from Levi’s
portion of the promised land.</p>

<p>Now to make a right bearing between the shadow and substance,
and render it eligible under the gospel for its ministers to
take pay, they must be such as are immediately called, as was
the house of Levi; and be deprived of any allotment in the land,
except room for residence, and some small suburbs: they must
likewise be under the unavoidable obligation of doing a great
deal of manual labour in outward things, or otherwise they are
not entitled to any outward pay: and all this only as their duty
to him, who hath called and appointed them, without making<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[Pg 220]</span>
any contract with the people at all for their service; for this was
not admissible under that dispensation: and all that did were
reproached by the Lord’s prophets as hirelings. An instance to
the point is the case of Micah, who had a house of idol gods; and
he hired a Levite to be his priest, and gave him for his service
ten shekels of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and his
victuals. Indeed we have in this Levite a true specimen of a
hireling; for when the Danites proposed to his consideration,
which would be best for him, whether to be a priest to the house
of one man, or to a tribe and family in Israel, he soon solved the
question; and it made his heart glad, and he took <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Micha’s">Micah’s</span> ephod,
teraphim, and graven image, and added theft to covetousness;
and went with the Danites, and became their idol priest.</p>

<p>Secondly, we are next to consider the perfect analogy between
the service of the priesthood under the law, and their wages,
agreeable to Paul’s expressions: “Do ye not know that they
which minister about holy things, live of the things of the temple,
and they which wait at the altar, are partakers with the
altar?” Now the things of the temple and of the altar were all
the Lord’s things; and as the priests and ministers were also the
Lord’s, he rewarded them out of his own holy things, and justice
required that it should be so. Therefore the priests under the law
had no right to call on the people for any pay, because there was
no contract between them: so likewise under the gospel, the Lord’s
true ministers must be such as are immediately called of God, as
was Aaron: but as there is no outward holy land under the gospel,
so neither is there any outward holy offerings or sacrifices,
nor any outward holy temple or altar of man’s building; so likewise
no outward victims to be slain or consecrated, hence no
outward reward: but the Lord’s ministers under the gospel are
all called and commissioned by his spirit, and clothed with his
power and authority to preach the gospel, not with wisdom
of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.
For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness,
but unto such as are saved it is the power of God. Hence those
who preach the gospel live of the gospel; that is, as the gospel is
the power of God, which is communicated to the people by gos<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[Pg 221]</span>pel
ministry, by which they are fed and comforted spiritually, as
the Israelites were outwardly, by their outward sacrifices, of
which the priests who ministered took their share with the people:
so likewise the ministers of the gospel, who minister to the people
spiritually in holy things; they also take their share, and are
made to rejoice together spiritually and mutually. And herein
consists the true analogy between the shadow and substance; the
first being the type, which consisted in outward things, and the
latter the antitype, consisting in spiritual things. For if the
reward of the Lord’s ministers under the gospel for their gospel
labours is to consist in outward temporal things, and likewise the
reward of the Lord’s ministers under the law was of the same
kind, then it would no longer hold as is generally agreed by
Christians, that the first is type, and the latter its antitype: but
it will be only type for type, and shadow for shadow; of course
we must look for another dispensation in order to do away the
shadow, and make way for the substance. “But thanks be to
God, which giveth us the victory, through our Lord Jesus Christ.”
He is the end of the law to all those who believe, and are
witnesses of his spiritual appearance in their hearts, to take
away sin and finish transgression, and fulfil all righteousness, in
those who willingly deny themselves, and take up their cross
daily, and follow him in the way of regeneration. Even so let
it be, saith my spirit, with the spirits of the faithful. Amen for
ever.</p>

<p>Sixth day. I had an appointed meeting in the town of Jamaica,
at the third hour in the afternoon. It was for the most
part a favoured meeting, although long in gathering. The
truths delivered had an affecting reach on many minds, and I
was made thankful for the precious solemnity which prevailed
over the meeting, and we parted under a comfortable sense
thereof. After this I returned home, and found my family well;
and my mind was clothed with peace, which favour inspires
grateful acknowledgments to the bountiful Author of every
blessing.</p>

<p>Seventh day. Rested with my family.</p>

<p>First day. Attended our meeting to good satisfaction. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[Pg 222]</span>
three following days spent with my family, and in my family
concerns.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended our preparative meeting, previous to the
sitting of which, I attended a funeral of one of our neighbours.
The corpse was laid in our burial-ground, and the people, after
the interment, came into the meeting. It was a large collection,
to whom the truths of the gospel were largely opened, and the
humbling power of truth spread over the assembly, contriting
many hearts.</p>

<p>Sixth and seventh days. Spent in my family concerns.</p>

<p>First day, the 16th. Attended our own meeting, sat it through
in silence. It was exercising in the forepart, in which I felt reduced
into a state of baptism, with and for the dead: but as I
abode in the patience, toward the close light sprang up and I was
relieved from the burden.</p>

<p>Second day. I spent in my temporal concerns. What a
strict and continual guard and watch it requires, when engaged
in any worldly business, to keep the mind free and loose from
every thing of a terrestrial nature; so that, at the first beck or
motion of the divine intelligence, we may be ready to obey, and
submit willingly to its holy requiring, without consulting with
flesh and blood.</p>

<p>Third day. I attended the funeral of a deceased Friend. A
meeting was held on the occasion at the place of her residence.
The neighbourhood were mostly of the Presbyterian order, many
of whom attended. I had an open time among them, to declare
of the things pertaining to the kingdom of heaven; and many
gospel truths were plainly set forth and exalted over all untruth
and errour. It was indeed a season thankfully to be remembered,
and my heart was bowed in grateful acknowledgments to the
great and blessed Author of all our mercies.</p>

<p>Fourth day. At the funeral yesterday, I was requested by
several of my friends to attend the funeral of an individual
who had been a professor among the Methodists, but whom I
had for some time believed was pretty fully convinced of the
principles of our profession; but the trial of parting with his fellow
professors, and making a full surrender, had kept him back,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[Pg 223]</span>
until being brought on a bed of languishing, he yielded and
acknowledged to the truth, and desired that in future his family
would attend <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Friend’s">Friends’</span> meetings: and towards his close, in order
to give full testimony to his belief, requested in a solemn manner
that after his decease his body might be taken into Friends’
meeting-house at Bethpage, which was not far from his dwelling,
and a meeting held there at his funeral, and desired that I might
be requested to attend. On consideration of the subject, Friends
were easy to comply with his request, and a meeting was held
accordingly. It proved a very solemn affecting time; many
hearts were tendered, and much brokenness and contrition were
manifest in the meeting, through the prevalence of the divine
power which accompanied the word preached. Surely it was the
Lord’s doing, and truly marvellous in the eyes of his people.
And oh! saith my spirit, what shall we render unto the Lord
for all his benefits, for his mercies are new every morning.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended our monthly meeting, and on sixth day
our preparative meeting of Ministers and Elders. In both of
these, my mind was engaged to stir up Friends to more watchfulness
and circumspection, for the right ordering of the concerns
of the society, and maintenance of our Christian discipline.</p>

<p>Seventh day. Spent in my family concerns, and ended the
week with a quiet mind.</p>

<p>First day, the 23d. Attended our meeting in silence. It was
rather an exercising dull time; but we ought not to murmur, for
if we had had our deserts, it might have been more so.</p>

<p>The rest of this week principally taken up in attending our
quarterly meeting in New-York. It was in general rather an
exercising time; for not only the answers to the queries from the
several monthly meetings, manifested many deficiencies as to the
right support of our Christian testimonies and discipline, but the
diversity of sentiment among the active members respecting the
full support of our testimony against war, also produced much
exercise to the faithful; especially with regard to the active compliance
in the payment of a tax, levied by the general government
of the United States, for carrying on war, and other purposes
of the government, which many Friends believed could not be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[Pg 224]</span>
actively complied with, consistently with our testimony on that
head. For refusing the payment of this tax, a number of
Friends had suffered in their property by distraint, to a considerable
amount more than the tax demanded, some even three or
four fold; whilst some others actively complied and paid the tax,
and justified themselves in so doing, which caused considerable
altercation in the meeting: nevertheless, I believe, Friends were
generally preserved in a good degree of harmony with each
other.</p>

<p>My mind was deeply baptized into the weak state of society,
and I laboured in the ability received to stimulate and encourage
Friends to faithfulness and perseverance, that so all our precious
testimonies for the Prince of Peace might be held up and exalted
as a standard to the nations.</p>

<p>First day, the 30th. A silent meeting. The rest of this week
spent in my family cares, except attending our fifth day meeting,
which I sat in silence.</p>

<p>First day, the 7th of 5th month. I sat our meeting again in
silence. The repeated seasons of rest that I have witnessed,
since returning from my arduous labour in New-York, have
brought to my remembrance the saying of the dear Master to
his disciples, when they returned from the service they had been
sent about, in visiting and preaching repentance to the Israelites,
and healing their sick, &amp;c.: “Come ye yourselves apart into a
desert place, and rest awhile.” I accounted it a favour, for which
I was thankful to the bountiful Author of all our blessings.</p>

<p>No particular call to any religious service during this week,
except in attention to our preparative meeting. Silent in the
meeting for worship.</p>

<p>First day, the 14th. Indisposition of body prevented my
attending meeting. I therefore spent the day quietly at home;
and in reading a portion of Moshiem’s Ecclesiastical History of
the Fifth Century, and which is indeed enough to astonish any
sensible, considerate man, to think how the professors of that
day could be hardy enough to call themselves Christians, while
using every artifice that their human wisdom could invent to
raise themselves to power and opulence, and endeavouring to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[Pg 225]</span>
crush down their opposers by almost every cruelty that power,
envy and malice could inflict, to the entire scandal of the Christian
name; and changing the pure, meek, merciful, and undefiled
religion of Jesus, into an impure, unmerciful, cruel, bloody,
and persecuting religion. For each of those varied sects of professed
Christians, in their turn, as they got the power of the civil
magistrate on their side, would endeavour, by the sword, and
severe edicts, followed by banishment, to reduce and destroy all
those who dissented from them, although their opinions were
not a whit more friendly to real genuine Christianity, than the
tenets of their opposers; for all were, in great measure, if not
entirely, adulterated and apostatized from the true spirit of Christianity,
which breathes peace on earth, and good will to man.</p>

<p>The rest of the week I spent in my family cares, except fifth
day, which was the time of our monthly meeting; in which the
women’s meeting brought forward, for our consideration and
concurrence, requests to be joined in membership for eight individuals.
Six of these were children, at the request of their father;
another, a minor of about ten years of age, who appeared very
desirous of membership: she sent forward her request, joined by
her parents. The other was an adult of a promising aspect, the
mother of several children. She had been brought up and educated
in the Episcopal profession; but being favoured with an
opportunity of attending Friends’ meetings, she was convinced of
the truth as held by us; and cheerfully submitted to the cross,
accounting the reproaches of Christ a greater treasure, than all
the comfort and delights that could be found among her former
associates in an outside pompous profession. Their requests were
all admitted by the meeting; and it was, I think, a comfortable
instructive season.</p>

<p>First day, the 21st. While sitting in our meeting my mind
was led into a consideration of the testimony of the apostle John,
where he assures us, agreeably to truth and right reason, that
God is love, and that they who dwell in love, dwell in God, and
God in them. My mind was opened to set forth to the people
the excellency of this state and the certainty of its attainment, by
all such as sincerely desire salvation; and in order therefor, are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[Pg 226]</span>
willing, through and by the leading and teaching of divine grace,
which the apostle Paul assures us, agreeably to our own sensible
experience, has appeared to all men, to forego all our selfish and
creaturely inclinations, and to deny self; and by bearing our cross
daily, come to a full crucifixion of the old man, with all his corrupt
and ungodly deeds. We thereby come to know a putting
on the new man, even Christ, or a salvation state, agreeably to
another declaration of the same apostle, where he asserts:
“Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature; old
things are passed away, behold all things are become new, and
all things are of God.” I was likewise led to show the good
fruits that would be the natural result of such a state, as certain
as good fruit is produced by a good tree; for we should no longer
love as man loves in his fallen state, from a selfish motive, self
being slain; but we should love as God loves, with a disinterested
love, and then we should love, not our friends and neighbours
only, but our greatest enemies also; and we should become qualified
sincerely to pray to God for them. We should then be
brought to discover, that all such among Christians as pray for
the downfall, or overcoming of their enemies by force of war, or
by any other means than pure disinterested love, pray not in a
Christian spirit, nor by the leading and influence of the spirit of
God; but in their own spirit, and by the leading and influence
of the spirit of antichrist. Therefore, such prayers are not heard,
but are an abomination in the sight of a pure and holy God, who
cannot behold iniquity with approbation. My mind was largely
and impressively opened on the subject; and with solemn weight
I left it upon the auditory, which was larger than usual: may it
have its desired effect, is the sincere desire of my spirit.</p>

<p>Second day. I attended the funerals of two elderly men of
Bethpage meeting. They were neighbours; and were both
interred in the meeting’s burial-ground at the same time. One
of them was a member; and the other was educated among
Friends, but had lost his right. A meeting was held on the
occasion, and there was a large collection of people. It proved
a solemn, and, I trust, an instructive time to some present: may
it fasten as a nail in a sure place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[Pg 227]</span></p>

<p>The rest of this week, except the usual weekly attendance of
our meeting, was spent in family cares, and in preparation for the
attendance of our approaching yearly meeting. Indisposition in
a branch of my family, prevented my attending the meeting for
Ministers and Elders; but got to the city in time to attend the
first day meetings. In the morning I was at Pearl-street, and
in the afternoon at Liberty-street; and although the latter was
pretty large, and in a good degree solemn, yet it was an exercising
season to the living sensible members.</p>

<p>In those large meetings, where Friends are collected from
various parts, the weak and the strong together, and especially
in those for worship, it is essentially necessary that Friends
get inward, and wait in their proper gifts, keeping in view their
standing and place in society, especially those in the ministry.
For otherwise there is danger, even from a desire to do good, of
being caught with the enemies’ transformations, particularly with
those that are young, and inexperienced; for we seldom sit in
meetings but some prospect presents, which has a likeness, in its
first impression, to the right thing; and as these feel naturally
fearful of speaking in large meetings, and in the presence of
their elderly friends, and apprehending they are likely to have
something to offer, they are suddenly struck with the fear of
man, and thereby prevented from centering down to their gifts,
so as to discover whether it is a right motion or not; and the
accuser of the brethren, who is always ready with his transformations
to deceive, charges with unfaithfulness and disobedience,
by which they are driven to act without any clear prospect,
and find little to say, except making an apology for their thus
standing; by which they often disturb the meeting, and prevent
others, who are rightly called to the work, and thereby wound
the minds of the living baptized members.</p>

<p>On second day the meeting for discipline opened, and continued
by adjournments until sixth day. Although divers
weaknesses were manifest, in transacting the business, for
want of a deep indwelling with the pure spring of life, and
each patiently abiding in his own proper gift, without envying
others, yet, I think, in the main it was a favoured meeting.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[Pg 228]</span>
Divers brethren were largely opened to speak to subjects of concern,
which came before us, in the life, and in the clear demonstration
of the spirit, as scribes well instructed, bringing out of
the heavenly treasury things new and old.</p>

<p>First day, the 4th of 6th month. Being invited to the funeral
of a young woman within the compass of Westbury meeting, I
attended that meeting, which was very large, much more so than
usual, occasioned in part by the funeral. Although the forepart
of the meeting was dull and exercising, yet, as my mind centered
under a patient exercise and travail, way gradually opened
to communication, in which I was enabled, through adorable
condescension, largely and livingly to declare to the people of
the things concerning the kingdom of heaven, and their own
present and everlasting peace. It was a season of great favour,
thankfully to be remembered.</p>

<p>The rest of this week I spent at home, in peace of mind.</p>

<p>First day, the 11th. My mind was brought under exercise,
as I sat in our meeting, in remembrance of Paul’s declaration,
where he says, “For all seek their own, not the things which
are Jesus Christ’s.” As I continued under the exercise, way
opened to communication, which brought a comfortable solemnity
over the meeting.</p>

<p>Second and third days. I spent in attending our meeting for
sufferings in New-York; an appointment which I have been
under for nearly forty years.</p>

<p>Fourth day. Most of this day spent in some necessary repairs
about my house. Much is saved by timely and prudent care.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Was our monthly meeting, at which we had the
acceptable company of our friend John Comly, a fellow-labourer
in the gospel, with whom I felt near sympathy and unity in
travail. I accompanied him the next day to a meeting he had
appointed at Martinicock; in which he was favoured with a
pretty large testimony, in the plainness and simplicity of the
gospel. I took my leave of him and his companion Stephen
Comfort that afternoon, and returned home.</p>

<p>Seventh day. Spent in my common avocations, and the
week closed with a peaceful mind.</p>

<p class="chap-head">Engagements at and about home, 1815.&mdash;Visit to the monthly meetings within
the circuit of Nine Partners quarterly meeting, 1815.</p>


<p>First day, the 18th of 6th month, 1815. My mind towards
the close of our meeting, was opened into a view of the excellency
and advantage of having our minds actuated invariably, by a
principle of strict and impartial justice, and of having just ideas
and apprehensions of the divine character. For nothing short
of this, is able to establish our faith in God on its right basis, and
to give us an unshaken hope and trust in his divine sufficiency,
and bring us to experience that love of our benevolent Creator,
and of our fellow creatures which casteth out all fear. As I
communicated, the prospect enlarged and brought a solemn
weight over the meeting, and we parted under a sense of the
favour.</p>

<p>The rest of the week was spent in close attention to my temporal
concerns, except attending our fifth day meeting.</p>

<p>First day, the 25th. Sat our meeting to-day in solemn silence,
being much depressed in mind on account of the improper conduct
of some of my friends, fellow members in society, by which
I apprehended the noble cause we had espoused was in danger
of being hurt, and the unity of the Church broken, which to me
was a cause of real sorrow of heart.</p>

<p>Except attending our fifth day meeting, which I sat in silence,
the rest of this week was occupied in my common avocations,
and ended with a peaceful mind, which is a hidden treasure of
more value than the golden wedge of Ophir.</p>

<p>First day, the 2d of 7th month. As I sat in our meeting, my
mind was early impressed with that important scripture passage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[Pg 230]</span>
of the psalmist: “Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered.”
It led to communication, in which I was largely opened to set
forth the very necessary truths it comprehended, especially as it
regards man’s salvation. For it shows clearly that man may
prevent his thus arising, and thereby hinder his own salvation:
and it also shows, that unless we know him to arise and become
supreme and chief ruler in our hearts, agreeably to his own good
will and pleasure, we cannot be saved nor come to know his enemies
to be scattered. Therefore it becomes us as poor helpless
creatures, patiently to wait, and quietly to hope for his arising,
with penitent hearts and willing minds, ready to receive him in
the way of his coming; although it may be “as a refiner with fire,
or as a fuller with soap.” It is also necessary for us to know this
arising to be within us and not without us; and to be with
power, binding the man of sin and son of perdition, which is
self, or the strong man armed; whose goods, while he rules, are
at peace: but when we permit a stronger than he, who only is
God, to come in or arise with power, “he will bind the strong man
armed, and cast him out; and then he will spoil his goods,” that
is, cleanse the heart from all the old rubbish of sin and uncleanness,
and purify his temple and make it a fit receptacle for his
holiness to dwell in. It was a season of favour. Many gospel
truths were clearly opened to the auditory who gave solid attention;
may they fix as a nail in a sure place.</p>

<p>I was under considerable bodily indisposition most of this week.
On fifth day, so much so, as almost to give up the prospect of
getting to meeting; but I put on my usual resolution and went,
and was glad in so doing, as there I met with that peace of God
that passeth all understanding, which is only known by being
felt. I had to declare to my friends how good it is to trust in the
Lord with all the heart, and lean not to our own understandings,
lest they fail us.</p>

<p>On sixth day I attended the funeral of a kinsman, a neighbour,
who had spent much of his life in a careless irreligious
manner, very seldom attending any religious meetings, and was
very ignorant as it respected the things of God and his own salvation;
but for a year or more before his death, he was greatly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[Pg 231]</span>
afflicted with bodily indisposition, from which he suffered long
and very deeply. It brought him to a solemn consideration
respecting his latter end, and I had a hope it worked for his
good, as he manifested a state of resignation; so that he bore his
affliction with much patience and quietude of mind. My heart
and my mouth were opened on the occasion, to warn the people,
and to call their attention to the necessity of an early preparation
for death; showing them that it bordered even on presumption,
for such poor impotent helpless creatures as we are, whose time
is dealt to us by moments, even to dare to close our eyes to sleep,
without first being well assured that our peace was made with
our great and gracious Creator. Many minds were considerably
humbled, and I hope the labour will not be lost, but be as bread
cast upon the waters, that some may gather after many days.</p>

<p>First day, the 9th. We had a comfortable favoured meeting
to-day. My mind was set at liberty to preach the gospel in the
clear demonstration of the spirit; and to show unto the people
that the reason why they were not healed of their many infirmities,
was not because there was not “balm in Gilead,” and “a Physician
there;” but because they were not willing to seek him in
the right way, and receive him in the way of his coming, which
is inwardly, as a refiner with fire, or a fuller with soap; to purify
from all the old leaven of self, and to cleanse the heart from all
self-righteousness, and self-sufficiency; that a thorough crucifixion
of the old man, with all his unrighteous deeds may be witnessed;
and the creature set at liberty to serve the Lord in newness of
life. The meeting closed with solemn supplication and thanksgiving
to the Lord for his continued mercy.</p>

<p>Second, third, and fourth days. Spent in my family affairs,
mostly attended with sweet peace of mind; although accompanied
with much bodily pain, which is more or less my common lot.
But what a great portion of severe bodily pain may be endured
without a murmuring thought, while accompanied with true
peace of mind, and a conscience void of offence toward God and
man: a rich consoling treasure.</p>

<p>Fifth day. This being the time of our preparative meeting, at
which our queries were answered, I had to admonish Friends to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[Pg 232]</span>
feel deeply after their own states. For as it is by individuals
that meetings are composed, so every individual ought to know
how far his particular state corresponds with what is queried
after; that so by a united labour, and an inward investigation
of our own particular states, we may be enabled to form true and
righteous answers to the superiour meetings. For if they are
false, it will be accounted lying and that not unto men, but unto
God; and thereby our queries be rendered very hurtful to us,
instead of being helpful.</p>

<p>Sixth and seventh days. I occupied myself in my usual
business, not <span class="correction" title="In the original book: feeeling">feeling</span> any particular religious draft; except the
necessity of keeping up the daily watch, that no intruding thoughts
lead into temptation, or prevent my daily converse with the God
of my salvation; whose presiding fear, I have long experienced
to be the only sure antidote against all evil.</p>

<p>First day, the 16th. My mind was led forth in our meeting
to-day in a large clear testimony, clothed with gospel authority,
which was introduced with the following apostolic exhortation:
“Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil;
cleave to that which is good. Be kindly affectioned one to another
with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another.” I
was led to show that this undissembling love was not to be known
by man in his fallen nature; but only by the regenerated soul,
the new man in Christ, who had come to know, in degree, a
partaking of the divine nature, as no other nature is congenial
with this love; a love, which the beloved apostle tells us, casteth
out all fear. It was a season of favour, thankfully to be remembered.</p>

<p>The remaining part of this week was principally employed in
helping to gather in our harvest, except attending our monthly
meeting on fifth day, and preparative meeting of Ministers and
Elders on sixth day: both of which were rather dull, poor meetings.
Alas! how the cares and cumbers of this world, like
thorns and briars, choke the good seed and prevent its bringing
forth fruit. Be watchful, O my soul! that so thou mayest know
thy seed time and harvest not to fail.</p>

<p>First day, the 23d. My present allotment is a state of depres<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[Pg 233]</span>sion
and poverty of spirit: but considering myself deserving thereof,
I do not complain. In this condition I accompanied my family
to meeting as the best thing I could do, not feeling the least qualification
to be in any degree useful to myself or to others; except
in a voluntary surrender of myself to be any thing or nothing, as
He, who has a right to dispose of his own workmanship at his
own pleasure, should see meet. But I had not sat long in this submissive
state, before a prospect presented to my mind, that opened
to a field of labour, in which I had to espouse the Master’s cause,
and demonstrate to the people present the just and indubitable
right he had to them and all their labours, without the promise
of any reward: and that our true and real felicity, in time and
in a future state, solely depended on this complete and willing surrender
of ourselves and all we have, to his holy and gracious
will; as nothing short thereof can produce our real sanctification
and adoption.</p>

<p>Second and third days. Nothing occurred worthy of particular
notice.</p>

<p>Fourth day. Was our quarterly meeting of Ministers and
Elders, held at Westbury. I attended under great depression
and poverty of spirit, which sealed my lips, as to any communication,
the greater part of the meeting. I sat resigned to my lot,
and heard my friends, or some of them, express their exercise,
which was principally directed to Ministers and Elders, especially
in regard to an honest, careful exercise of their gifts as such; and
also alluding to the dulness and want of life that too generally
attended those meetings. I felt very little effect wrought in the
meeting from their labour, and could take no part in it; but as
I sat patiently waiting, and endeavoured quietly to endure the
cloud that was spread as a veil over the meeting; it clearly
opened on my mind, that it was not brought over us in consequence
of a deficiency in ministers, as it respects their ministerial
gifts, nor from a want of care in elders in watching over them;
but from a much more deep and melancholy cause, viz: the
love and cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches; which,
springing up and gaining the ascendency in the mind, choke
the good seed like the briars and thorns, and render it fruitless;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[Pg 234]</span>
and produce such great dearth and barrenness in our meetings.
As the matter spread with a degree of animation on my mind,
I found it my place, near the close of the meeting, to open the
prospect and sound an alarm to Friends, which appeared to have
a quickening effect on many minds, and enabled us at parting,
to renew our trust in the Almighty arm of divine sufficiency, and
still to believe that the Lord had not altogether forsaken his people,
but was mindful of the seeking remnant of his heritage, and
continued his gracious calls to his backsliding children.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Was the meeting for discipline. It was likewise
rather an exercising season, but I hope attended with some profit.</p>

<p>Sixth day. Was the parting meeting held for public worship.
It was a large crowded meeting, but was somewhat hurt in the
forepart, by the appearance of one young in the ministry standing
too long, and manifesting too much animation: yet, I believed,
he was under the preparing hand, fitting for service in the Church,
if he only keeps low and humble, and does not aspire above his
gift, into the animation of the creature. For there is great danger,
if such are not deeply watchful, of the transformer getting in and
raising the mind into too much creaturely zeal, and warmth of
the animal spirit, whereby they may be deceived, and attribute
that to the divine power, which only arises from a heated imagination,
and the natural warmth of their own spirits; and so mar
the work of the divine spirit on their minds, run before their gift
and lose it, or have it taken away from them. They thereby fall
into the condition of some formerly, as mentioned by the prophet,
who, in their creaturely zeal, kindle a fire of their own, and walk
in the light thereof; but these, in the end, have to lie down in
sorrow.</p>

<p>Towards the close of the meeting, as Friends kept quiet and
solid, way opened for further communication, which brought a
comfortable solemnity over the meeting; and we parted from
each other with gladdened hearts, under a grateful sense of the
Lord’s mercy to his unworthy creatures.</p>

<p>Seventh day. I turned my hand again to my usual industry
in my family affairs, with a peaceful mind.</p>

<p>First day, the 30th. Devoted this day, as usual, to the attend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[Pg 235]</span>ance
of our own meeting, in which I had not sat long, silently
musing, before my mind was opened into a view of the divine
attributes, especially that of God’s unchangeableness, and with
which I had to contrast the changeable and unstable state of
man. I was led, in the view thereof, to show to the people, that
all our infelicity arose out of our unsettled state, and for want of
being established, or fixed on some steadfast and invariable principle;
and as there is no other but God, consequently all our
true felicity and salvation depends on our being entirely settled
and fixed in and upon him, by which we are brought to witness
an unchangeable state, having the feet of the mind established
on the immoveable rock, <i>Christ, the light of the world</i>, and
the real spiritual life of all true believers. For nothing short of
this experience ought to satisfy, or give rest to any seeking, panting
soul after God its redeemer.</p>

<p>The rest of this week I attended to my family avocations with,
generally, peace of mind, attending our fifth day meeting, as it
came in course; nothing unusual occurring, but having daily
and continual cause of thankfulness to the bountiful Author of
every blessing, both temporal and spiritual.</p>

<p>First day, the 6th of 8th month. My lot was to suffer the
greater part of our meeting to-day, until near the close, when
I found it my place to unite in a short testimony with a female
fellow labourer, in calling the attention of the people to an inward
exercise and faithful improvement of the gift or talent committed
to them, while time and opportunity are afforded, that so
when called, they might be prepared to render up their accounts
with joy.</p>

<p>Spent the remainder of this week as usual, at and about
home, feeling no call abroad to any religious service; but felt it
my incumbent duty simply to wait, and to watch at the King’s
gate.</p>

<p>First day, the 13th. Towards the close of our meeting, my
mind was led to view the great and singular advantages which
would result to mankind, by a full surrender of their wills to the
divine will, not only in religious concerns, but also in things of
a temporal nature, and indeed in every thing they do. The sub<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[Pg 236]</span>ject
became very impressive, insomuch that I found it my place
to spread it before the auditory; and to set forth the inconsistency
of people, in first acknowledging the entire supremacy of the
divine Being, and their own dependant state, as tenants at will
of the sovereign Lord of the universe; and at the same time
presumptuously exercising an independent will and judgment in
their temporal, and, mostly so, even in their religious concerns.
Therefore, without breach of charity, we may safely conclude,
that the generality, even of professed Christians, serve and worship
the creature, more than they do the Creator. To this we
may refer the source of all the misery and wretchedness of man;
and that to rise out of his fallen state, he must come to know a
complete sinking down into a state of nothingness of self, and a
full surrender of his will to the divine will, and not to move in
any thing without being conscientiously satisfied it is in correspondence
therewith; then should we move on safely, and peace
of mind would be our daily attendant.</p>

<p>In the course of this week I was indisposed, being afflicted with
much bodily pain; but was enabled to attend our monthly meeting
on fifth day, at which we received extracts from our yearly
and quarterly meetings, with the printed epistle from London.
They furnished suitable advice on several subjects, particularly
relative to a right attendance of our religious meetings. I was
impressed also with a similar concern, to call the careful attention
of Friends thereto, as that upon which our religious advancement
greatly depends.</p>

<p>First day, the 20th. Feeling a draft on my mind to sit with
Friends of Bethpage, I yielded thereto. I sat the meeting mostly
in silence, it being rather a dull, low time, and but little life discoverable
in the meeting; yet near the close, I felt a small
motion leading to communication, and as I gave way thereto, a
small stream of life arose, and ran through the meeting, and we
parted under a sense of its comforting influence, with thankful
hearts.</p>

<p>First day, the 27th. My mind was solemnly exercised during
the greater part of our meeting, and deeply impressed with the
spirit of prayer and supplication. Oh, how awful is the prospect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[Pg 237]</span>
of approaching the Majesty of heaven in solemn prayer! How
it reduces the creature, and shows him his entire unworthiness
and helpless state. Well might the prophet thus exclaim:
“When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the
voice; rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in
myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble.” As I sat under
the humbling prospect, I was strengthened, towards the close of
the meeting, with a bowed down mind and bended knees, to
address my humble petition, on behalf of myself and my friends,
to the throne of grace, expressive of the desire of my soul,
that we might be kept, both old and young, at all times, under
an humbling sense of the divine fear, as that on which all our
safety and preservation depends.</p>

<p>Second and third days. I spent with a family of my friends
some distance from home, my wife accompanying me. I had
been for some time under considerable exercise and concern on
account of some uneasiness and disunity which subsisted among
them, greatly to their hurt. I entered fully into the subject, and
was favoured, through patient perseverance, to bring matters to a
peaceful close, for which I was thankful, as the harmony of the
family had been for several years very much interrupted.</p>

<p>Fourth day. We returned home.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended our meeting held this day, in which I
was silent.</p>

<p>Sixth day. I spent principally in assisting a friend, who was
somewhat straitened in getting along with his husbandry concerns;
he having been indisposed.</p>

<p>Seventh day. Attended the funeral of a very ancient woman
Friend, an elder in society. She lived to the age of ninety-seven
years, an example of prudence and plainness; of an innocent
life and conversation, and generally beloved by her acquaintance.
A large collection of Friends and others attended it. I
was led to set forth the great advantages the true believer has
over the unbeliever; and to show to the people the great necessity
of care that we did not place any confidence in a mere traditional
or historical belief, without coming to a real experimental
knowledge of God and Christ. It was a solemn time; many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[Pg 238]</span>
hearts were tendered with the savour of truth, that spread over
the meeting.</p>

<p>First day, the 3d of 9th month. Feeling a small draft of love
and concern to sit with Friends of Westbury meeting to-day, I
yielded thereto. It proved rather a low dull season, very little life
felt to be stirring in the meeting; but a little before the close, I
felt my mind quickened with the remembrance of the occurrence
which took place with Jesus and his disciples a short time previous
to his being taken prisoner, and carried before Pilate; but, in a
particular manner, my mind was impressed with the proceedings
of Judas the traitor. It opened on my mind that he was a true
figure of self in man, which is the son of perdition, and man of
sin. I was led, in the opening, to warn Friends to beware of
him, each one in themselves, for otherwise he would deceive, and
betray them, as Judas did his Master; and who will as certainly
destroy the precious life in us, as he brought Christ to
his crucifixion; his delight is to scatter and expose to trial and
temptation. It spread with weight over the meeting, and many
minds were solemnly affected. Surely the Lord’s mercy is still
great towards his backsliding people, as he continues striving to
gather and preserve them from all evil.</p>

<p>The rest of the week I spent as usual, nothing particular
occurring.</p>

<p>First day, the 10th. This day I was pretty closely engaged.
Attended our own meeting in the morning, and an appointed
meeting at Jerusalem in the afternoon. Both were meetings of
favour, and comforting seasons to the upright in heart.</p>

<p>Second day. Visited a sick brother. Found him very ill, his
case being such as to render his recovery very doubtful. It caused
much distress in the family. Oh! how wise it is for such dependant
creatures as we are, and whose stay here is so uncertain, to be
always in a state of readiness to meet every event. What consolation
it affords in such trying seasons, when we can come to
say, Lord, thy servant is ready.</p>

<p>I returned home on third day evening. Fourth and fifth
days employed as usual. On sixth day paid him another visit,
and found him much better, and the family cheerful. Oh, how<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[Pg 239]</span>
unstable a creature is man! full and empty, joyful and sorrowful,
as things go well or ill. All this is for want of having the mind
centered in and on God, its alone proper object and sure balance.</p>

<p>I tarried until first day, and had an appointed meeting in the
neighbourhood; and although not so large as I have sometimes
had in that place, yet it was in the main an open favoured season,
exciting thankfulness to the blessed Author of all our mercies. I
returned home that evening, leaving my brother in a favourable
way of recovery, with a hope that the visitation will be profitable
to him and his family, if they rightly improve it.</p>

<p>The rest of the week I spent at and about home. Attended
our monthly meeting on fifth day, and the funeral of a female
relative on sixth day, who was taken off very suddenly with an
apoplectic fit. Such instances speak a language to survivors
very urgent and expressive: “Be ye therefore ready also.”</p>

<p>First day, the 24th. After a considerable time of silent waiting
in our meeting, my mind was quickened in the remembrance of
the following declaration of the apostle Paul: “For by grace are
ye saved, through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the
gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.” The
subject opened to communication, wherein I had to unfold
to the people the utter incapacity of man, in his fallen or
natural state, doing any thing that would, in the least degree,
further his salvation, or be acceptable to God, as a part of his
necessary duty or service to him. For it would be very unwise
and dangerous to presume or attempt any such thing: unwise,
because it is impossible for him to effect it, and dangerous, lest he
should do something that might warm or stir up his own passions,
or those of others, in such manner as to apprehend that a
degree of the divine power attended. For this would tend to
lead to a very fatal errour, a continuance in the presumption;
which can produce no other, than darkness and death to the
soul. In this state he could not possibly avoid boasting, and
thereby counteract the apostle’s doctrine; and indeed it would be
justifiable to boast, if we could do the least thing of ourselves,
without the immediate aid of divine grace. For strict justice
cannot deny the ascription of merit to any cause that produces a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[Pg 240]</span>
real good work; but as no mere man can possibly ever be such a
cause, so he can never merit any good from his own works, and
therefore he never can have a right to boast. All this the truly
humble are abundantly sensible of, and therefore dare not attempt
any thing in a religious way, in their own time and will, but
wait patiently for the immediate inspiring of divine grace, to
whose power only, as the procuring cause of our salvation, all
merit is due.</p>

<p>The rest of the week I spent in my usual avocations, not
omitting my religious duties as they opened on my mind.</p>

<p>First day, the 1st of 10th month. My mind, while sitting
in our meeting to-day, was led into the consideration of the
real necessity there was for each individual to know God, before
he could worship him acceptably, in spirit and in truth.
For if we are ignorant of him, our worship would be no better
than the worship of the Athenians to an unknown God. The
subject enlarged and opened to the communication of divers
gospel truths, and gave cause gratefully to acknowledge the
mercy and goodness of our heavenly Father to his backsliding
children.</p>

<p>The six following days I was occupied at and about home,
with a grieved mind most of the time, on account of the conduct
of some of my neighbours, particularly one of my tenants, and
one other, who spent the week principally attending horse
races; a most pernicious practice, leading to more evil than almost
any other wicked custom that the loose and the vain are so
foolishly addicted to; for it is not only spending our precious
time in a vain and wanton manner, but likewise manifests great
ingratitude to the Author of all our blessings, if not a total disbelief
in him: for how can it be supposed that a rational mind, that
has a real belief in God, could have hardiness enough to drive a
horse in a race, to gratify a number of idle and vain spectators;
and if for a bribe or a wager, it adds greatly to the sin, as it is
then accompanied with covetousness and dishonesty. When we
consider that the horse is one of the great temporal blessings
conferred on man, by a gracious and beneficent providence, to abuse
him without cause, by driving him in a race, is both cruel and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[Pg 241]</span>
wicked; for his life, and the life of his rider are both at stake, as
it sometimes happens that both are killed. And not one single
real good ever has arisen, or ever can be looked for, from it: for
the truth of which, I dare appeal to any rational man who was
ever in the practice, that it has never produced one hour of real
peace to the mind.</p>

<p>First day, the 8th. As I sat in our meeting, the declaration
of Paul, introductory to his epistle to the Hebrews, presented to
my mind, and opened to a very interesting communication,
showing that “God, who at sundry times and in divers manners,
spake in time past unto the fathers [in Israel] by the prophets,
hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he
hath appointed heir of all things.” This renders it necessary for
every true follower of him, to hear him in all things, as now,
under the gospel dispensation, we have no other sufficient teacher
but the Lord Jesus Christ, by his spirit in our hearts; therefore,
they who do not hear and obey him, cannot be saved, but, agreeably
to the testimony of Moses, “the wrath of God abideth on
them.”</p>

<p>Second and third days. Were taken up in attending our
meeting for sufferings. The rest of the week I was occupied in
my temporal concerns, except attending our preparative meeting
on fifth day.</p>

<p>First day, the 15th. Although in going to meeting to-day my
mind was under the impression of poverty and spiritual want,
yet I had not sat long, ere light sprang up, and opened to the
communication of divers weighty gospel truths. In the unfolding
of these, I was led to open to the people, that every birth was
clothed in its own proper nature, and which must be congenial
to the spring or source from whence the birth derived its existence.
Hence, agreeably to the apostle Paul’s declaration, “The
first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord
from heaven; and as we have borne the image of the earthy,
we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.” Therefore, as
the earthy or animal part in man, must draw all its succour and
support from the earth, and cannot be comforted nor subsist
without earthly food; so neither can the spiritual part, or the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[Pg 242]</span>
immortal soul of man, be comforted or subsist in its true life,
without spiritual food.</p>

<p>This, and much more, I was led to open in the light of truth,
at this solemn time; for the Lord’s power spread over the meeting
in a very weighty and sensible manner, and we parted under
the precious covering. Oh that our hearts might be continually
warmed with gratitude for such unmerited mercy!</p>

<p>Fifth day. Since first day, I have been busily employed in
putting my family affairs in order, so as to leave home in company
with a committee appointed by the yearly meeting, to visit the
quarterly meeting of Nine Partners, with the monthly meetings
constituting it, this being the time to set out. I also attended the
funeral of a deceased neighbour, on fourth day, where I had a
favourable opportunity of expostulating with a large assembly, on
the fallen, weak, and helpless state of man, and the necessity of
his witnessing, through the aid of divine grace or spirit of his
Creator, a redemption therefrom, as the only means whereby he
can be saved, and be again renewed into his divine image and
become a partaker of his real nature, as no other nature can be
happy in the enjoyment of him.</p>

<p>I accordingly left home on sixth day, the 20th of 10th month.
My wife and daughter Elizabeth set out with me, with a view
of bearing me company in part of the visit. We rode through
New-York to Westchester, and lodged with our kind friends
Thomas and Elizabeth Underhill, in our way to West Hartford,
in Connecticut, that being the first monthly meeting we were to
attend, in the arrangement made by the committee. On seventh
day we continued our journey to Middlesex, and lodged with our
friends Samuel and Phebe Bishop. On first day attended Friends’
meeting there; and some notice being given to the neighbouring
inhabitants, of our intention of attending it, the meeting was
large, and through the condescending goodness of the Shepherd
of Israel, it proved a comfortable edifying season. The doctrines
of the gospel were freely and largely communicated, and the
truth raised into dominion above all, to the glory of him who is
over all, God blessed for ever. On second day we proceeded on
our journey, going by way of Bridgeport, in order to visit a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[Pg 243]</span>
female Friend of our acquaintance who lived in that town, far
separated from her friends and relatives; and whose husband
being a seafaring man, was from home on a voyage. She was
comforted, and glad of the visit, although short. After dining
with her, and staying as long as our time would admit, we proceeded
that afternoon to Woodbury, and lodged with Elijah
Sherman, a person of the Methodist persuasion, and an old
acquaintance, where we were hospitably entertained. The next
day we rode to West Hartford, and put up with our kind Friend
Ruth Gilbert, widow of Charles Gilbert. Fourth day, being the
day their usual meeting was held, we attended it; and although
small, was nevertheless a precious favoured season. The states
of those present were spoken to in the fresh flowings of gospel
love, tendering and contriting the hearts of most present. Surely
it was the Lord’s doing, and worthy of deep thankfulness to him,
as the alone author of every blessing.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Was their monthly meeting, held at this time
out of its usual course to accommodate the yearly meeting’s committee.
It proved a satisfactory season. The few Friends constituting
it, appeared to conduct the business which came before
them, in a good degree of propriety and harmony.</p>

<p>On sixth day we took leave of our friends there, and rode to
Oblong; a long journey of about fifty-five miles, and the way
rough and hilly. We lodged with our friend Azariah Howland,
and the next day attended Oblong monthly meeting, which
proved, through heavenly help, particularly the part for worship, a
comfortable edifying meeting. Near the close, feeling a draft on
my mind to be there the next day at their first day meeting, I
informed Friends thereof before we parted; and notice being
given to the neighbouring people of my intention, the meeting
was large; and through the unmerited condescension of our gracious
Helper, ability was given to preach the gospel in the clear
demonstration of the spirit, and with power. The spirits of most
present were humbled and contrited, and the truth raised into
dominion, to the praise of Him, who calleth us to glory and
virtue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[Pg 244]</span></p>

<p>After this favoured meeting, we parted with our friends, under
a lively sense of the Lord’s goodness, and rode that evening to
Nine Partners and took quarters with our kind relations Isaac
and Anne Thorne.</p>

<p>The two following days we attended the monthly meetings
of Nine Partners and Oswego, which were, in the main, solemn
edifying seasons.</p>

<p>On fourth day we rode to Cornwall, leaving my wife and
daughter with our relations at Nine Partners. The three following
days, attended the monthly meetings of Cornwall, Marlborough,
and Rosendale Plains. With grateful hearts, we had
abundant cause to acknowledge the goodness, and never-failing
loving kindness of our heavenly Father, in condescending to be
with us from day to day, making bare his arm for our help and
furnishing with ability for the work we were engaged in, both
in meetings for worship, and those for the right ordering of the
affairs of the Church. The several opportunities were crowned
with His gracious presence, solemnizing and tendering the hearts
of the people, and comforting and gladdening the sincere in heart,
who prefer the prosperity of Zion to their chiefest joy.</p>

<p>First day. We attended Marlborough meeting; and some
notice having been given to those of other societies, of our intention
of being there, the meeting was large, and the house much crowded.
Through divine favour extended to us, it proved an awakening
precious season; the testimony to the power of truth went forth
and reigned victoriously over all. We tarried here until the next
day, and then returned to Nine Partners, in order to attend the
quarterly meeting, which opened the next day with a meeting for
Ministers and Elders. Here I again met my wife and daughter.
The quarterly meeting closed on fourth day afternoon, and was
in the main an instructive favoured season, although considerably
interrupted by the imprudence of a Friend, in his unwarrantable
opposition to a concern, which was opened to draw Friends
off from the too free and unnecessary use of articles, which
were the produce of the labour of the poor enslaved black people;
and which was wrung from them, while in a state of cruel bond<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[Pg 245]</span>age,
by their hard-hearted task masters. For the sufferings of
those oppressed people, my mind was deeply exercised.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Rode to Stanford, and attended the quarterly meeting
of Ministers and Elders, which through condescending goodness
proved a comfortable edifying opportunity, as was that for
discipline. The following day the quarterly meeting closed, with
a meeting for worship on seventh day. It was a season thankfully
to be remembered by every sensible mind present; for he
that opens and none can shut, and shuts and none can open,
was graciously near, and condescended to open many deep
doctrines of the gospel, in a full and clear manner, in the demonstration
of the spirit, attended with power; humbling and solemnizing
the minds of most present, and exalting the truth, which
was raised into dominion, and ran sweetly over all.</p>

<p>We returned that evening to Nine Partners, intending to sit
with Friends there the next day; and some public notice being
given that we were there, the meeting was large. Although it
proved rather an exercising season, and the labour hard, yet, I
trust, it was a season of profit and instruction to many.</p>

<p>After this meeting, feeling myself released from any further
service, the committee having fulfilled their appointment, and
my wife feeling anxious to return home, we took leave of our
friends on second day afternoon and rode to our friend Enoch
Dorland’s at Beekman. The next day we rode to Croton, and
lodged with our friend James Jordan. On fourth day we proceeded
on our journey to Manhattanville, and lodged with our
friend Joseph Byrd; and the following day, attended the little
meeting of our friends at that place. After this we rode down to
New-York, and took up our quarters at the house of our friend
and kinsman Whitehead Hicks. We tarried in town until
seventh day morning, and then took leave of our friends and
rode home, where we arrived just before evening.</p>

<p>We were from home about four weeks, in which time I travelled
four hundred and eighty-four miles, and attended two quarterly
meetings which held five days; seven monthly meetings,
and five particular meetings. We had especial cause of gratitude
and thankfulness of heart, to the great and beneficent Author of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[Pg 246]</span>
every blessing, in that our journey was prosperous, and ourselves
preserved in a comfortable degree of bodily health during the
time, although a season of very general indisposition with those
among whom we travelled.</p>

<p>First day, the 19th of 11th month. I sat with our friends
again in our own meeting, and found it my place to set them an
example of silence, feeling my situation like Mordecai’s when
sitting at the king’s gate: a state as grateful to an humble mind
as riding the king’s horse, and more safe, as there is less danger
of falling.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Another silent meeting.</p>

<p>Seventh day. Attended the funeral of a deceased neighbour.
My mind was largely opened, to set forth to a large auditory
assembled on this solemn occasion, the great and blessed effects
of a firm belief and faith in the living God; as it has proved an
antidote to all evil in every age of the world, and to every individual
who has had this true and living faith. For it is that by
which the just live, and this the apostle saith, is our victory, even
our faith; and without it, it is impossible to please God. The
Lord’s power accompanied the communication, and many hearts
were broken and contrited by its heavenly influence; may it not
pass away as the morning dew, but fasten as a nail in a sure
place, driven by the Master of our assemblies, is the fervent desire
and prayer of my mind.</p>

<p>First day, the 26th. I passed our meeting to-day mostly in
silence, except just before the close, I found it my place to remind
the meeting of the complaint of the apostle Paul in his epistle to
his beloved Timothy, concerning some in that day, who were
ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the
truth. The occasion of this was, as it opened on my mind, their
neglect of practical duty, and unfaithfulness in what they styled
little things; and thereby rendered themselves unfit and unworthy
of being made rulers over more; and yet were continually seeking
after knowledge in greater things, through the medium of
the outward ear, and creaturely comprehension; loving to hear
the truth declared and doctrines communicated, but unwilling
and neglectful of putting them in practice; and therefore made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[Pg 247]</span>
no advancement in true learning. I had to warn my friends to be
careful not to render themselves liable to the same reprehension,
and found sweet peace in this small portion of duty.</p>

<p>The rest of the week I spent about home, being somewhat
indisposed. Sat our fifth day meeting in silence, quietly waiting,
as at the king’s gate, for renewed instruction.</p>

<p>First day, the 3d of 12th month. My mind has been much
shut up since I returned home. Sat our meeting again to-day
in silence; but felt a daily exercise and concern relative to a
religious visit in New England, which has for months past, been
ripening on my mind; but have a prospect of some services about
home, ere I engage therein. Lay low, oh my soul! that thou
mayest be rightly and wisely directed therein; for thou well
knowest the greatness, and vast importance of the work thou art
called to; and that of thyself, thou art utterly destitute of any
right ability to perform it to thy own good, or to the glory and
honour of thy chiefest good, who is the Lord alone, thy gracious
and all-sufficient helper.</p>

<p>Second and third days. Attended to some necessary concerns
about home, preparatory to the approaching winter. On fourth
day afternoon rode to Flushing, in order to attend the monthly
meeting the following day, with a further prospect of having
two other meetings on sixth and seventh days, one at Newtown,
and the other at the Kilns, in my way to New-York, where I felt
drawings on my mind to be on first day. Accordingly after attending
the monthly meeting, having the company of my kind
kinsman Isaac Hicks from Westbury, with the assistance of some
Friends of Flushing, we procured the appointment of a meeting
the next evening at Newtown at the sixth hour, principally for
those not in membership with us. As there were no Friends
residing in the village, the meeting was held in a large upper
room at an inn, which was nearly filled with sober and orderly
behaved people. Through heavenly help, it proved a comfortable
edifying season; the doctrines of the gospel were freely and largely
opened, apparently to the general satisfaction of those present,
and many hearts were humbled and contrited.</p>

<p>The next day we attended an appointed meeting in Friends’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[Pg 248]</span>
meeting-house at the Kilns. Although not large, yet it proved
a precious tendering opportunity to most present, worthy to be
remembered with thankfulness and gratitude to the blessed Author
of all our multiplied favours and blessings. After this we dined
with our kind friend Jane Betts, and then proceeded to the city.</p>

<p>First day. We attended Pearl-street meeting in the morning,
and that at Liberty-street in the afternoon. In the former, the
testimony of truth went forth with power, and its dignity and
excellency were exalted over all opposition, to the praise of Him
who is calling and leading all his devoted and obedient children
out of darkness into his marvellous light, wherein they are
brought to witness a full remission of their sins, and an inheritance
among all those that are sanctified. The latter meeting I
sat mostly in silence; but towards the close, I was led forth in a
short searching testimony, which brought a solemnity over the
meeting, under which covering the meeting closed.</p>

<p>Second day. I attended a committee of the meeting for sufferings,
and in the afternoon a funeral of one not a member, but
whose parents were inclined to Friends, and frequently attended
Friends’ meetings. They hearing of my being in town, requested
my attendance at the funeral; and being disposed thereto, I
attended accordingly, and had an open time to declare the truth
to those present, suited to the occasion, and many minds were
humbled.</p>

<p>Third day. I attended the meeting for sufferings, and on
fourth day the meeting held in the middle of the week at Pearl-street,
at which there was a marriage; which occasioned the
meeting to be quite large, and in which my mind was exercised
in an unusual manner. For the subject which first presented,
after my mind had become silenced, was the remembrance of the
manner in which the temporal courts among men are called to
order; and it became so impressive, as to apprehend it right
to make use of it as a simile, much in the way the prophet
was led to make use of some of the Rechabites, to convict Israel
of their disobedience and want of attention to their law and
lawgiver. I accordingly was led to cry audibly three times,
“O yes, O yes, O yes; silence all persons, under the pain and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[Pg 249]</span>
penalty of the displeasure of the court.” This unusual address
had a powerful tendency to arrest the attention of all present,
and from which I took occasion, as truth opened the way, to reason
with the assembly, that if such a confused mass of people as
are generally collected together on such occasions, and from very
different motives, and many from mere curiosity to hear and see
the transactions of the court, should all in an instant so honour
and respect the court, as immediately to be still and silent at the
simple call of the crier: how much more reasonable is it, for a
collection of people, promiscuously gathered to the place appointed
in a religious way, to wait upon, and worship the Judge of heaven
and earth, to be still, and strive to silence every selfish and creaturely
thought and cogitation of the mind. For such thoughts
and cogitations would as certainly prevent our hearing the inward
divine voice of the King of heaven, and as effectually hinder
our worshipping him in spirit and in truth, as the talking
of the multitude at a court of moral law, would interrupt the
business thereof. As I proceeded with this simile, the subject
enlarged and spread, accompanied with gospel power and the
evident demonstration of the spirit, whereby truth was raised into
victory, and ran as oil over all. The meeting closed with solemn
supplication and thanksgiving to the Lord our gracious Helper,
to whom all the honour and glory belong, both now and for ever.</p>

<p>We left the city that afternoon, under a grateful sense of the
Lord’s goodness, and rode to Flushing, where we had a large
public meeting that evening, mostly of those not in membership
with us. It was a solemn season, instructive and edifying. I
returned home the next day, and found my family in a reasonable
state of health; surely may I not, with propriety and humility
of heart, exclaim with one formerly: “What shall I render unto
the Lord for all his benefits towards me?” Are not his mercies
new every morning? his faithfulness faileth not.</p>

<p>Sixth and seventh days. I was industriously occupied in my
family affairs, and the week ended with peace of mind.</p>

<p>First day, the 17th. I was led in our meeting to-day, to call
Friends’ attention to the cross; assuring them, that if we lived
without the cross, we must expect to die without the crown. For<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[Pg 250]</span>
as the cross consisted only in doing right, and doing right only in
a conformity to the will of our heavenly Father, and doing all
our works agreeable to his good pleasure and not our own,
therefore, doing right is always a cross to our fallen nature, as
nothing can do right in the sight of God, but a birth or child of
God. For although a man in his fallen state may do a moral
act, that in itself is a right work, yet, doing it for his own pleasure
and will, and not because it is agreeable to the will and
pleasure of his Creator, it cannot be accepted as a good act,
because the motive and principle were evil, being selfish and
not of God.</p>

<p>Second day. Busily employed about home and in home affairs.</p>

<p>Third day. Visited a sick friend at his request. Assisted him
in settling his business and wrote his <i>will</i>. Surely this is a work
which requires sound judgment and discretion, therefore ought
always to be done in time of health, with proper deliberation, and
not in haste.</p>

<p>Fourth day. Attended Westbury monthly meeting, to my
own, and I trust, my friends’ comfort and satisfaction. I believe
it was a season of instruction and profit to many who were present;
may it fasten as a nail in a sure place.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended our own monthly meeting. The meeting
for worship, through close labour, proved a quickening tendering
season to many present. In the meeting for discipline, I
found it my duty to spread before my Friends, a concern which
had for many months been, at times, very impressive on my mind,
to pay a visit in gospel love, to Friends and others in some parts
of the yearly meeting of Rhode Island. After due deliberation
thereon, they united with it and gave me their certificate, leaving
me at liberty to pursue the prospect, as truth might open the
way. This brought me under serious reflections, in a view and
consideration of the great responsibility which naturally attaches
to those who thus go out on this solemn embassy, with the concurrence
of their Friends. For not only their own reputation as
ministers of the gospel, must rise or fall, according to their good
or ill conduct, but likewise that of their Friends, and the society
they profess to be ministers of; and also, the truth which they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[Pg 251]</span>
seem to espouse, instead of being advanced, may be retarded
thereby. Lay prostrate, O my soul, at the throne of grace, and
seek that wisdom which is only profitable to direct, that thou
mayest be thereby strengthened to endure hardness, as a good
soldier and servant of the Prince of Peace.</p>

<p>Sixth and seventh days. Busily employed in so arranging
matters at home, as to leave it with a peaceful mind.</p>

<p>First day, the 24th. A profitable edifying meeting with my
Friends at home. I was led to sound forth a gospel message
among them, in an arousing searching testimony, by which many
minds were humbled and contrited.</p>

<p>Second and third days. Employed in making preparation for
my proposed journey.</p>

<p>Fourth day. Attended Friends’ meeting at Westbury, at
which there were two marriages accomplished; which occasioned
the meeting to be very large. Many of other societies came out
of curiosity to see the manner of our marriages, amongst whom,
I was largely opened in communication, to set forth many gospel
truths necessary to be believed and witnessed in our own experience,
in order to our salvation. It was a season of favour, and
a very solemn time; may it be blessed and sanctified to the
lasting benefit of all who were present, is the fervent desire and
travail of my spirit.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended our meeting in silence. The two following
days busily engaged in arranging my temporal concerns,
and putting them in order, that I may leave home with a peaceful
mind.</p>

<p>First day, the 31st. A solemn meeting to-day, in which my
mind was led forth in humble supplication for support and preservation
in my proposed journey; and that the Lord our gracious
helper, in his guardian care, would be pleased to be near my
dear family and friends at home, and be their comfort and
strength in every needful time; and that all those who sit in
darkness and the shadow of death, might be redeemed therefrom,
and translated into the kingdom of God, that so his truth
might prosper and spread from sea to sea, and from the rivers
to the ends of the earth; that his great and excellent name<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[Pg 252]</span>
might be praised and magnified by all the nations of the earth,
from the rising of the sun, to the going down thereof, world
without end. Amen.</p>

<p>Second and third days. Still busily engaged preparatory to
leaving home, with a prospect of setting out on fourth day morning,
if way should open.</p>

<p class="chap-head">General visit to Friends in New England, 1816.</p>


<p>Fourth day, the 3d of 1st month, 1816. After taking a
solemn and affecting opportunity with my dear wife and children,
I took leave of them under a sense of the Lord’s goodness and
gracious regard, and proceeded on my intended journey. Called
on my kind kinsman Isaac Hicks, of Westbury, who had previously
concluded to go with me as a companion. We proceeded
that afternoon to New-York, where we tarried over the next
day. On sixth day morning we left the city, and arrived at
Bridgeport, in Connecticut, on seventh day evening, where we
had a small though comfortable meeting, the next day, at the house
of Thomas Woodward, whose wife was a member of our society.
After this we proceeded to New Haven, and lodged. On second
day we rode to Hartford, and lodged.</p>

<p>On third and fourth days, rode to Leicester, and lodged with
our friend Pliny Earle. On fifth day had an appointed meeting
there, at the eleventh hour. A number of the neighbouring
people, not of our society, attended with Friends, among whom
was their priest. It was, I think, a season of favour, in
which my heart and mouth were opened, under, I trust, the
influence of gospel love, to declare the way of life and salvation
to the people; proving from the scriptures, and clear rational
demonstration, that nothing short of the inspiring spirit of truth,
could enable any rational creature to make the least progress in
a real Christian life, or qualify to worship the Father of spirits,
in spirit and in truth; and that a confession to all, or any creeds
or forms of religion, however specious in their appearance, without
the immediate aid of this inspiring spirit, would, in the end, leave<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[Pg 254]</span>
the soul in utter disappointment. I was also led to show the
unreasonableness and inconsistency of the doctrine of unconditional
election and reprobation, and that it was impossible to
be drawn from a right and enlightened view of the divine
character.</p>

<p>There occurred one circumstance in the meeting, which, as it
was in itself improper, and gave some interruption to my mind,
I am willing to mention as a caution. When the meeting had
got pretty quietly settled, and my mind opened with a prospect
to stand up, just before I was about to rise, there came in a
stranger, in appearance; and a Friend who sat near me spoke to
him to come forward, and called him <i>parson</i>, meaning a priest,
which I was very sorry to be informed of: for I think that
Friends ought to be exceedingly careful, never to inform travelling
ministers the state or condition of those who attend their
meetings, as it not only has a tendency to close up the way very
much, of real gospel ministers, but when close and plain things
are delivered, they often are judged of having outward information
of the condition of those to whom it applies; which, if it be the
case, it would most likely be the means of rendering their labour
useless; but if from inquiry such find that the speaker was utterly
ignorant of them, from any outward discovery, it is then much
more likely to fix on their minds and become useful.</p>

<p>After dining with our friends, we proceeded on our journey
about thirteen miles that evening, with a view of endeavouring to
get an opportunity with Friends at Bolton, the next day; but the
morning opened with a pretty severe snow storm, which rendered
it impracticable. However, we proceeded in the morning through
the snow, and with much difficulty reached that place, where we
tarried until first day. We had then a very comfortable edifying
meeting with Friends; and continued there, at the house of our
kind friend John Fry, until second day morning, and then proceeded
to Lynn.</p>

<p>On third day, the 16th, we proceeded to Seabrook, in order to
attend the quarterly meeting, which opened the next day with a
meeting of Ministers and Elders. On fifth day was the quarterly
meeting for discipline, preceded by a meeting for worship. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[Pg 255]</span>
was a season of favour, especially the meeting for worship,
wherein my mind was largely opened to preach the gospel in the
demonstration of the spirit, to the comfort and edification of the
upright in heart; many being reduced into a state of humble
contrition and thankfulness for the unmerited mercy.</p>

<p>On sixth day we proceeded to Epping, where, by previous
notice, we had a meeting in the evening, in which the Lord’s
power and presence presided in a very eminent manner; and
his truth raised into victory over all, and ran as oil, quieting and
solemnizing every thing that stood in opposition to its pure holy
influence. I scarcely ever was at a meeting, wherein all were
so swallowed up in a profound solemnity, that when the meeting
closed, it was sometime before any removed from their seats.
Surely it was the Lord’s doing.</p>

<p>From thence we went the next day to Lee, and had a small
comfortable meeting at the eleventh hour, and then proceeded to
Dover. On first day attended Friends’ meeting there at the
eleventh hour, at the close of which, feeling a draft of love
towards the inhabitants of the town at large, with the unity of
Friends, there was a meeting appointed in the evening, and
general invitation given; at which there was a very large collection
of the various sects, amongst whom my mind was largely
opened, and my tongue loosed, I trust, by Him who opens, and
none can shut, and shuts and none can open, to declare of the
things concerning the kingdom of God, and to point out to the
people, in a very clear manner, the way of life and salvation,
unfolding many important doctrines of the gospel, in the clear
demonstration of the spirit, bowing and humbling many minds
present, and rejoicing the hearts of the faithful; under a sense
whereof my mind was bowed in deep abasedness for the favour.</p>

<p>Next morning we proceeded to Berwick, and had an instructive
edifying meeting there in the evening, wherein many hearts,
with mine own, were made thankful. The next day we proceeded
to Portland, a town on Casco Bay. The following day,
being the fourth of the week, we rode to Falmouth, and attended
their select meeting, constituted of the Ministers and Elders
belonging to Falmouth meeting. It was small, and the business<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[Pg 256]</span>
conducted in a very weak, and, in my view, a very improper
manner; for, previous to the meeting, it appeared that the clerk
had, at his leisure, entered the business of the meeting, as though
at meeting, and made answers to all the queries; so that when
the meeting collected, they had nothing to do, but to hear him
read over what he had before written, and which, without any
alteration, was approved; some representatives to the quarterly
meeting appointed, and the meeting closed. On taking a view of
the subject, I was led to believe that meetings, held in such a way,
brought no honour to the cause, nor strength nor profit, to those
who attend them.</p>

<p>At the close of the meeting, we rode to our friend John Winslow’s,
and lodged; and the next day attended Falmouth monthly
meeting. The two following days we attended the select meeting
at Windham, and their monthly meeting. First day attended
Windham meeting; and on second day, an appointed meeting
at Gorham. On third day we rested, and wrote. On fourth
day their quarterly meeting opened at Windham, which closed
on fifth day. Sixth day, had an appointed meeting at Falmouth.
On seventh day rode to Durham; and on first day attended
their meeting, which was large, notice having been given to the
neighbouring inhabitants of our coming. Second day, rode
back to Portland, and had an appointed meeting with Friends
and others that evening. On third day attended an appointed
meeting at Cape Elizabeth, and then returned to Portland, and
had a large public meeting in the evening. On fourth day we
were at Scarborough.</p>

<p>I then felt my mind released from any further service in this
quarter; but before I proceed, am led in humble gratitude and
thankfulness of heart, to acknowledge the goodness and mercy
of Israel’s Shepherd, who, in his never-failing love, was graciously
near from place to place, and clothed the assemblies with his
presence and power, opening my mind in every meeting for
worship, to preach the gospel, humbling and contriting many
minds, and comforting and edifying the willing and upright in
heart. Surely it is the Lord that worketh in us and for us;
magnified and adored be his right worthy name, both now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[Pg 257]</span>
and for ever, to whom all the praise belongs: nothing due to
man.</p>

<p>After the meeting at Scarborough, I went with my kind friend
William Cobb to his house at Gorham, he having taken me in
his chaise from Portland to Scarborough; for our way of travelling
was with a sled: but the snow on the seacoast was so wasted
as to render it difficult getting along with it. It was therefore
concluded that my companion should go back into the country
to Gorham, where the snow was more abundant; and William
accompanied me as aforesaid. We met again in the evening at
his house, and the next day returned to Berwick, and the day
following to Dover.</p>

<p>On seventh day I proceeded to Rochester, accompanied by
Thomas Stackpole. My companion being unwell, it was thought
best for him to rest until our return. We attended the upper
meeting in that town in the evening; and the next day, at the
eleventh hour, were at the lower meeting. After this we returned
to Dover, to attend a meeting in the evening, which had been
concluded to be appointed previous to my going out; and general
notice having been given, it was very large. They were all
seasons of favour, in which the Lord’s presence was felt to preside,
and truth raised into dominion; particularly the last, wherein my
heart and mouth were largely opened, and the gospel preached
in the demonstration of the spirit, attended with power, solemnizing
this large assembly. Truth reigned, and the meeting
closed with humble supplication and prayer to the Lord.</p>

<p>Second day, the 12th of 2d month. We returned to Seabrook,
to the house of our kind friend Joseph Phillbrick, and had an
appointed meeting there that evening. The next day proceeded
to Almsbury and Newbury, and had a meeting at each place, the
latter in the evening. They were open favoured seasons, particularly
the meeting at Almsbury, in which truth prevailed, and ran
as oil over all. A ministering friend observed, after the meeting,
that he believed the witness was raised in every mind present.
It was indeed a precious strengthening opportunity to my own
mind: may the honour and praise be all ascribed to Israel’s
Shepherd, to whom it is altogether due. How deeply humbling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[Pg 258]</span>
are such continued mercies, dispensed to us poor unworthy creatures.
Lay low, O my soul! for thou well knowest that it is the
Lord’s power only, clothed in righteous judgment and never-failing
mercy, that has raised thee from the dunghill, where thou
hadst plunged thyself by thy own follies; yea, it is he who has
plucked thy feet out of the mire and clay of sin, and set them on
a rock, and strengthened thee in faith to believe, that as thou
dwellest in deep humiliation before him, resting on his mercy,
until self is fully mortified, and the old man with his deeds is
utterly crucified, he will establish thy going, and put a new song
into thy mouth, even eternal praises to thy God. Even so be it.
Amen.</p>

<p>We left Newbury on fourth day morning, and returned to
Salem, and attended their meeting, the next day, as it came
in course, at which there was a marriage accomplished between
two worthy Friends, elders in society. It was a comfortable
edifying season, in which I was led to set forth the
deep and solemn obligations which mutually attach to the
parties entering into the marriage covenant&mdash;obligations that
can never be rightly and harmoniously fulfilled, so as to render
the parties truly happy together, unless they are of one mind
and one heart, in all matters of importance, but more especially
in regard to their principles of religion and faith; for if
these are diverse, it will most likely imbitter their enjoyments,
and produce discord in their family, and tend to wound and
distract the minds of their children, should they be favoured with
any. It therefore bespeaks great presumption and folly in young
people to risk the attempt, especially on such slender reasons as
are commonly brought forward as a plea, that one of the parties
may change their opinion, and come to unite with the other.
This, however, is very fallacious, as such change is uncertain;
and no man of reason will trust thereto in the most trivial matters,
for each generally suppose themselves in the right, and look for
the other to condescend and conform; and therefore the breach
often becomes greater.</p>

<p>On sixth day evening, we had an appointed meeting for the
inhabitants of the town in general. It was very large, consisting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[Pg 259]</span>
of the various religious sects, and some of almost every description
of people, who commonly reside in such populous towns. I was
largely opened among them in the line of the ministry, in which
I was led to set forth the excellency of man’s primitive state,
before the fall, in which he was placed by the wisdom and goodness
of his all-wise and gracious Creator, and furnished with
sufficient light and understanding to know that he was altogether
the work of his almighty power, and that he derived his life and
existence, with every other blessing he had, or could have, from
his bountiful hand; under a just sense whereof, while he stood in
this happy state, every desire of his soul flowed with a continual
ascent to him, as his only comforter and preserver. In this state
he realized the condition the apostle reminds us of in this exhortation:
“Rejoice evermore; pray without ceasing; and in every
thing give thanks:” this being the only true delineation of a
faithful servant of God. But from this happy state man fell, by
a wrong use and abuse of those powers and capacities conferred
on him as a free agent, and without which he neither could have
known nor served his God: therefore, man’s fall was altogether
an act of his own choice, contrary to known duty; and had it
not been so, he could not possibly have felt guilt and condemnation
for what he had done.</p>

<p>I was also led to open to the people that the great end of
Christ’s coming was to introduce the gospel, which is the last
and most blessed dispensation of God to the children of men, as
by it only can man be restored to this primitive state, and without
which restoration he cannot effectually serve God in spirit. This
gospel our Lord told his disciples his Father would send them in
his name, and which is the Holy Ghost or power of God sent
down from heaven, which well agrees with the doctrine of the
apostle Paul, where he tells us, that the gospel of Christ “is the
power of God unto salvation, to every one that believeth.” This
therefore supposes, that those who do not obey the spirit of truth,
or Holy Ghost, which convinces them of sin, do not believe the
gospel, and therefore are not benefitted by it: of course they
remain under the power and dominion of sin.</p>

<p>After this favoured meeting, I felt myself much indisposed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[Pg 260]</span>
with a very severe cold and fever, and had to keep house until
the next third day, when we proceeded to Lynn. The following
day we attended their meeting held in the middle of the week;
and notice being given of our intention of being there, it was
large. The power of truth went forth freely, tendering many
minds, and comforting the faithful and upright in heart.</p>

<p>The next day we proceeded on our way to Long Plain, where
we arrived the day following, about noon. Had a meeting there
that evening. The day after had a meeting at the eleventh
hour, at Accushnet. They were both favoured meetings.</p>

<p>We then proceeded to New Bedford; and the next day, the
first of the week, and 25th of 2d month, we attended their forenoon
and afternoon meetings. In these my mind was largely
opened in gospel communication, tending to expose the man of
sin and son of perdition, manifesting that he was nothing but
self in man, and showing that, in his mysterious workings, in
leading man to endeavour to imitate God, in doing good and performing
acts under the show of religion and religious worship,
but all done in his own will and time, the whole mystery of
iniquity is comprehended. For in man’s thus turning away
from God and the inspirings of his holy spirit, consists his fall,
as he takes upon himself an independent state, and assumes the
right of self-government, and becomes his own director; therefore,
his salvation wholly consists in surrendering up this self-ability,
letting it die on the cross, and returning into a state of full
submission to the leading and sole guidance of the inspiring
spirit of God. My mind was largely opened on these and other
truths of the gospel in those meetings, whereby truth was raised
into dominion over all, to the comfort and peace of my own mind,
and to the apparent satisfaction, instruction, and edification of
the rightly exercised and seeking minds present.</p>

<p>The three following days we attended meetings at Newtown,
Centre, and the monthly meeting of Dartmouth, or Aponegansett.
In each of these I was largely opened in gospel communication,
particularly in the last. The truth was powerfully raised into
dominion over all, spreading a precious solemnity over the meeting,
and much contrition of spirit was manifested. It was the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[Pg 261]</span>
Lord’s doing, and to him belongs all the praise of his own work,
nothing due to the creature but blushing and confusion of face.</p>

<p>Fifth and sixth days. We had meetings at Acoaksett, alias
West Port, and Little Compton. In both the gospel was preached
in truth’s authority; the latter especially was a powerful melting
season to most present, inspiring the mind with deep thankfulness
and gratitude to the bountiful Author of every blessing.</p>

<p>On seventh day we proceeded to Newport, on Rhode Island,
and attended Friends’ forenoon and afternoon meetings on first
day. On second day, had an appointed meeting at Portsmouth.
After this, with peace of mind, we left the island that afternoon,
and went to Tiverton, and lodged with our kind friend Joseph
Barker. We had an appointed meeting there the next day, and
the day following were at Swansey. Truth was eminently
exalted in these meetings, especially the latter, which was a
powerful baptizing season, in which the Lord’s presence was
witnessed, and much brokenness and contrition of spirit was
spread over the meeting. This was witnessed, not only by
Friends, but by many others not in profession with us, encouraging
and gladdening every sincere mind for the unmerited
favour. After this solemn meeting, we took leave of our Friends,
and rode that afternoon to Providence.</p>

<p>The next day we attended Friends’ meeting there, as it came
in course, in which my mind was led to exemplify and set forth,
the excellency and blessed effects of true and strict justice in all
our dealings and commerce between man and man, as rational
social beings; which was introduced into my mind by the remembrance
of this saying of the wisest of men, viz. Solomon:
“Righteousness exalteth a nation, but sin is a reproach to any
people.” My mind was opened to show the great and essential
difference there is, between the righteousness of man, as comprehended
in, and tolerated by the laws, customs, edicts and traditions
of men, and the righteousness of God, which is altogether
comprehended in pure, equal, impartial and unchangeable justice:
showing that every act of man, which is not in conformity to
this pure and impartial justice, is sin; and that whatever we do
that has a tendency, either directly or indirectly, to counteract<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[Pg 262]</span>
this pure, simple, impartial justice, cannot be considered as any
part of that righteousness which exalts a nation, as it cannot
bring glory to God; for no righteousness, but God’s righteousness,
wrought in man by this pure principle of justice, can possibly
glorify him, as this must be the foundation of every virtue in
man.</p>

<p>It was a season of close searching labour, by which the hidden
things of Esau, or the first nature, in which the serpentine wisdom
works, deceiving multitudes; was brought to light and
exposed: especially that cunning sophistical reasoning in the
wisdom of this world, which many people are making use of to
justify themselves, and thereby stifle and put to silence the convictions
of conscience, while acting in direct opposition to this
pure principle of justice; by continuing a traffic in, and making
themselves rich, by a commerce in the produce of the labour of
the poor, afflicted and deeply oppressed Africans and their descendants,
held in a state of slavery by the mere force of war,
and which is wrested from them without their consent. Truth
was exalted over all, and unrighteousness exposed, and its evil
effects on societies and individuals manifested.</p>

<p>After this arduous meeting, not feeling myself clear of the
town, I appointed another meeting in the evening. Public notice
being given, it was large, not only of the white inhabitants, but
a large number of the people of colour also attended. It was a
season of favour, and much doctrine was communicated, suited
to the states of those present; tending to the edification and
instruction of the seeking minds of the varied sects, many of
whom were collected in this solemn assembly. I closed with a
peaceful mind, and the next day we proceeded to Scituate, and
had a very edifying tendering meeting there.</p>

<p>The day following, being the first of the week, we were at
Friends’ meeting at Foster. It was a small meeting of Friends,
but a very considerable number of the neighbouring people came
in of different persuasions. I was led to open and explain among
them many essential doctrines of Christianity, which, crossing the
carnal views of these outside professors, and striking at their
creaturely activity in their religious services, I felt as I proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[Pg 263]</span>
a strong spirit of opposition in some of this description, but truth
favoured so that no outward opposition was manifested, and the
meeting closed under a covering of solemn quiet.</p>

<p>On second day evening we attended an appointed meeting in
Friends’ meeting-house at Plainfield. There are but few Friends
belonging to this meeting, the whole consisting of but three families;
but a considerable number of their neighbours came in and
sat with us. We likewise appointed another meeting the next
day at a Friend’s house in the northern part of this town, at the
second hour in the afternoon, which was well attended by the
neighbouring people. These two last meetings closed my visit to
Friends and others, in the compass of Rhode Island yearly meeting.
They were opportunities of favour, in which much gospel
instruction was communicated, to the general edification, comfort
and satisfaction of the people, and which was acknowledged by
many of them. In parting with them I felt the incomes of sweet
peace, as a crown to all my deep exercises and ardent gospel
labours, in this visit to Friends and others in the compass of
that yearly meeting: a sense of which humbles my mind in
deep thankfulness and gratitude, to the bountiful Author of
all our mercies and blessings, who is over all, God blessed for
ever.</p>

<p>We proceeded from thence on fourth day, directly to the city of
Hartford; and on fifth day evening had a large meeting there,
held in a meeting-house belonging to the Baptists. I was led
forth among them in a large doctrinal testimony, showing that
Christ’s coming in the flesh, was designed to supersede the dispensation
of Moses, which stood in mere legal righteousness,
consisting of carnal ordinances, and relating only to the outward
or animal body, made up of circumcision, outward sacrifices, elementary
washings and cleansings, and the blood of slain beasts,
&amp;c.: all which were only outward, and therefore could not effect
the soul, nor make the comers thereunto perfect, as pertaining
to the conscience.</p>

<p>I was likewise led to open the nature of the true Christian
Sabbath, which is the antitype of the typical one, and does not
consist in a rest to the body merely for a day, but in a perpetual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[Pg 264]</span>
rest to the soul by its coming into Christ, and submitting to the
government of his spirit, and entirely ceasing from its own willings
and runnings, by which reconciliation is witnessed, and peace
made with our heavenly Father. These things and much
more, I had to open to the people, in the fresh feelings of the love
and life of truth, which was exalted over all. The next day we
rode to Woodbury, with a prospect of obtaining a religious opportunity
with the people; but way not opening for it, we proceeded
the day after to New Milford, and the next day being the first of
the week, we had a comfortable edifying meeting with Friends,
and a large collection of their neighbours with them.</p>

<p>After this, we rode that afternoon to Oblong, and the next day
attended the monthly meeting there. In the meeting for worship,
the Lord’s power was eminently exalted, and truth was
raised into dominion; the season was deeply instructive and edifying.
The day after we had an appointed meeting in the town
of Patterson, where no Friend resides. It was held in a school-house,
and proved, through divine favour, an instructive baptizing
season. From thence we proceeded to the Valley, and the
following day had a precious strengthening opportunity with
Friends and others, in Friends’ meeting-house there.</p>

<p>We then rode to North Salem, and the next day being their
meeting day in the middle of the week, we attended it: and
notice being given that we were there, it was considerably enlarged
by a number of the neighbouring inhabitants coming in.
The forepart of the meeting was exercising: my mind, in silent
waiting, was dipped into a deep sense of poverty and darkness,
and as I sat patiently under the impression, I was led gradually
into a view of the cause, which appeared to be too much creaturely
activity and a froward will. As light began to arise and
expel the darkness, there was brought to remembrance these expressions
of Solomon: “Keep thy foot when thou goest to the
house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice
of fools: for they consider not that they do evil:” and also,
“But the talk of the lips tendeth only to penury.” These
were opened in a way that led to communication, in which I
had to show the very hurtful tendency of creaturely activity in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[Pg 265]</span>
matters of religion and religious worship, and the absolute necessity
of a complete redemption from self, and all self motives, in
the great work of our salvation. As I proceeded, the life rose, and
truth prevailed and spread over the meeting in an eminent
manner. After this favoured meeting, I found there was sufficient
cause for my exercise; and I was glad that I was altogether
ignorant of it from any outward information.</p>

<p>The next day we had an appointed meeting at Amawalk.
It was favoured with the Lord’s presence and power; and many
hearts were contrited and made thankful, under a sense of his
continued mercy.</p>

<p>We proceeded from thence to Peekskill, where, by previous
appointment, we had a meeting the following day, which was
crowned with the Lord’s blessing. Surely the Lord is good and
gracious, and his mercy endureth for ever; for did he deal with
us according to our deserts, surely we might ere now all have
been consumed: for as I passed along from place to place, I discovered
great unfaithfulness, and want of right submission to the
divine will, with many Friends as well as others; under a feeling
sense whereof, I was often led in a line of close searching
doctrine, by which the hidden things of Esau, or the works of
the first birth or fallen nature were brought to light and exposed,
in a way that showed it was the Lord’s doing: and my heart,
with the hearts of the faithful few were made glad in his power,
and his everlasting loving kindness to the children of men.</p>

<p>The next day being the first of the week, we attended Croton
meeting. The number of Friends there is small, but the meeting
was large for that place, for many of other societies came in.
The doctrines of the gospel were freely and largely preached
among them, to the instruction and edification, I believe, of most
present, and to the peace and comfort of my own mind.</p>

<p>Our next meeting was at Shapaqua, which was large, and a
favoured season. The two following days we had meetings at
Croton Valley and North Castle, in both of which I was helped
to clear myself among the people in a line of plain doctrine. The
next day and the fifth of the week, we had an appointed meeting
at Purchase, which was a large satisfactory meeting. The two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[Pg 266]</span>
following days we attended meetings at Mamaroneck and Westchester;
in both of which, the Lord’s power was manifested for
our help, and the gospel preached in the demonstration thereof,
and its divine influence tendered and contrited many hearts;
especially in the latter, which being the last meeting I had in
this journey, it proved a crowning season, in which truth was
raised into victory over all, and the Lord’s name praised and
magnified for his goodness and marvellous loving kindness to the
children of men. After this solemn meeting I felt myself at
liberty to return home, where I arrived safe that evening, and
found most of my family in usual health.</p>

<p>I was from home nearly three months in this journey, travelled
upwards of one thousand miles, and attended fifty-nine particular,
three monthly, and two quarterly meetings.</p>

<p>First day, the 31st of 3d month, 1816. Having returned from
my aforesaid journey last evening, sat with Friends in our own
meeting to-day. I felt things to be very low in a religious sense,
and my mind clothed with much poverty, which appeared to me
in the openings of truth, to be occasioned by Friends suffering
their minds to be too much overwhelmed with the surfeiting cares
of this life, which I was led to open to them in a plain though
tender manner. It had a reaching effect on the meeting, and
contrited many hearts; may it fasten as a nail in a sure place, is
the fervent desire of my mind.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Since first day I have been somewhat circumstanced
as Mordecai formerly at the king’s gate, waiting and watching
in much poverty of spirit, against intervening temptations,
while making some necessary arrangements respecting my temporal
affairs; being desirous that they may all be so conducted,
under the ordering and limitation of truth, as to accord with the
will of my heavenly Father, and thereby bring glory to his excellent
name. Sat our meeting to-day in silence.</p>

<p>Sixth and seventh days. Nothing transpired requiring particular
notice.</p>

<p>First day. I was led in our meeting to-day, under a sense of
the great want among mankind in general of a right concern to
become acquainted with their Creator, to set forth the great loss<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[Pg 267]</span>
and suffering which must necessarily result to them from this
state of ignorance, and want of the true knowledge of God, and
of his will concerning them.</p>

<p>Seventh day, the 13th of 4th month. This week has passed
since first day, without feeling sufficient to warrant making a
short note; but being at present musing on the past time, and feeling
no condemnation, although I had passed the present week
mostly in caring for my temporal concerns; yet not so much, I
trust, from the love I have for the world or the things of it, but
more especially from a sense of duty, that I may honestly provide
for the outward welfare of myself and family, and have,
through the blessing of a kind and benevolent Providence on my
frugal industry, a sufficiency when called from my home and
from every temporal enjoyment there, for the gospel’s sake, to
keep the gospel free from charge, and that I abuse not my power
in the gospel. For this care, I often fear is too much wanting by
some who go out on that solemn embassy; which, if not guarded
against, may not only tend to frustrate the end of their labours,
but prove a stone of stumbling to many seeking minds. For
how inconsistent it must appear in those who profess to have
taken up their cross to self and the world, to follow their self-denying
Saviour in the plain path of duty, to be anxious about
what they shall eat or drink, or what they shall wear; or manifest
a desire after praise or applause from their Friends or
others, or have their hands and hearts open to receive the gratuities
of the rich. For all these may be considered when sought
after, as bribes to the receivers, and it places such under the appellation
of hirelings; for although there may not have been any
previous contract, yet, receiving benefits in that way, I conceive,
will bring the receiver under obligations to the giver, and place
the individual in a situation not fit for a free minister of the
gospel.</p>

<p>First day. Sat our meeting to-day mostly in silence, and in
suffering with the seed, that lies oppressed as a cart under sheaves,
in the minds of most of the professors of Christianity; but towards
the close a gleam of light broke forth, in the remembrance of
that saying of Christ, where he tells us, that the kingdom of God<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[Pg 268]</span>
is within, and that it doth not come through outward observation.
The subject opened in a lively manner on my mind, which led
to communication, and brought a solemn weight over the meeting,
and we parted under the favour.</p>

<p>The three following days I kept much within, being under
very considerable bodily affliction, although, at intervals, so as to
pay some necessary attention to my family affairs, not being
willing to let any portion of precious time pass away unimproved,
as I cannot suppose that any part of our time is dispensed to us
for nought.</p>

<p>Fifth day. This was the time of our monthly meeting, at
which the queries were answered, and accounts prepared to go
up to the yearly meeting. How deep and solemn our deliberations
are on such occasions, not only that our answers may be consistent
with truth, without any false colouring or evasion, but that
all may be done under the influence of that divine power, which
humbles and abases the creature, and which only can qualify for
the Lord’s work and service, whether in ministry or discipline.
At this time I returned the minute I had from the meeting, to
perform my late visit to Friends in New England, with a short
account of my journey.</p>

<p>Sixth day. Attended our meeting for Ministers and Elders,
at which nothing unusual occurred.</p>

<p>Seventh day. Quietly spent in my temporal concerns.</p>

<p>First day, the 21st. My mind, in our meeting to-day, was
brought under a deep feeling exercise, in sympathy with backsliders,
and such as, having been often reproved, continue still to
revolt. The power of truth went forth to these in a searching
arousing manner: may it prove effectual to produce in such more
stability and faithfulness to the convictions of divine grace, which,
as they become fully obedient thereunto, will work their salvation;
otherwise these may share the fate described by one formerly:
“He that, being often reproved, hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly
be destroyed, and that without remedy.”</p>

<p>The rest of this week I spent principally in attending our
quarterly meeting, held at this time in New-York. It was for
the most part a favoured season, but would have been more so,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[Pg 269]</span>
had not some in the ministry quite exceeded the mark by unnecessary
communication. For very great care ought to rest on
the minds of ministers, lest they become burthensome, and take
away the life from the meeting, and bring over it a gloom of
death and darkness, that may be sensibly felt.</p>

<p>First day, the 28th. A silent meeting to-day.</p>

<p>Second day. In the afternoon of this day I accompanied a
friend to a meeting he had appointed at Jerusalem. There was
a considerable collection; but the meeting proved trying, not
only in the silent part, but when our friend was communicating,
there seemed to be a great weight of death over the meeting, and the
people appeared generally very dull and lifeless. I was very much
borne down under a feeling sense of it, so that I had not the
least prospect that I should have any thing to communicate, as
I felt nothing in myself to offer, nor did there appear any disposition
or fitness in the people to receive; but just before the close,
some time after the Friend had sat down, there was a small presentation
opened on my mind, attended with a degree of life,
which, as I yielded thereto, it spread a comfortable calm over
the meeting generally, insomuch that I thought that the
fragments which were left, after each had had their portion,
were more than the whole stock in the beginning, like the
fragments of the loaves and fishes, when the multitude were
fed formerly.</p>

<p>I accompanied the aforesaid Friend on fourth day to Bethpage,
but sat the meeting in silence. He appeared in a pretty long
testimony, but it was rather a dull heavy season, and but little
life to be felt, so true is that saying, that, “Except the Lord build
the house, they labour in vain that build it; except the Lord
keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.” He returned
with me and attended our meeting the next day, and had a
pretty favoured time in the meeting, and was led to open divers
passages of scripture in a pretty clear manner, which rendered
the season instructive and satisfactory.</p>

<p>Sixth and seventh days. Passed without any thing transpiring
worthy of remark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[Pg 270]</span></p>

<p>First day, the 5th of 5th month. Being invited to attend the
funeral of one of my wife’s cousins, on Cowneck, I accompanied
her thereto. There was a large collection of people; but by
their untimely and irregular gathering, the opportunity was
much interrupted; yet, through the condescending goodness of
Israel’s Shepherd, the power of truth went forth freely to the
people, tendering and contriting many hearts, particularly among
the youth: may it fix on their minds as a nail, driven by the
Master of assemblies, in a sure place.</p>

<p>The rest of this week I spent about home, being somewhat
unwell; yet not so much so, but that I attended our preparative
meeting on fifth day.</p>

<p>First day, the 12th. Feeling considerably indisposed, I did
not get out to meeting to-day; yet had to reflect how very seldom
I had been prevented by indisposition for many years past, being
generally preserved in health, a favour worthy of grateful
acknowledgments.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended our monthly meeting. It was a low
dull season, through the greater part of the first meeting; but
just before the close, a small gleam of light appeared, which,
with a short communication from a female, brought the meeting
to a pretty comfortable conclusion.</p>

<p>Sixth and seventh days. Spent in my family avocations,
clothed with poverty of spirit, yet not altogether cast down, being
encouraged at times with the remembrance of the divine promise
succeeding the flood, that, “While the earth remaineth, seed-time
and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter,
and day and night, shall not cease.” As in my past winter
journey, I witnessed summer and harvest, so now I may rest
patiently in the divine promise, with the assurance, that as
winter in due course has succeeded summer, so likewise summer
by and by, in its turn, will succeed winter, and the time of the
singing of birds will come, and the drooping spirit will again
rejoice in the Lord, and joy in the God of its salvation.</p>

<p>Nothing requiring a note the following week, except, that on
seventh day, the 25th of the month, I proceeded to New-York,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[Pg 271]</span>
in order to attend our approaching yearly meeting, which opened
for Ministers and Elders at the tenth hour this morning; but
the morning being rainy, we did not arrive in season to attend
the first sitting. The meeting continued by adjournments until
the following sixth day, and was in the main, I think, a favoured
meeting, the Lord graciously manifesting himself to be near,
suppressing forward spirits, that would now and then start up to
the hurt of the meeting, and uniting the living baptized members
in a joint travail for the promotion of right order, and the increase
of the Messiah’s kingdom in the earth. We returned home on
seventh day.</p>

<p>First day, the 2d of 6th month. Attended our meeting in
the morning in silence; but in the afternoon meeting, appointed
by a friend from Pennsylvania, I had a pretty full opportunity,
after the Friend who appointed the meeting had relieved his mind,
to call the people’s attention to the only sure guide, the light
of God’s spirit in their own hearts and minds, which reveals to
every man and woman all things that they had ever done, as
Jesus did to the woman of Samaria, reproving for the evil, and
justifying for the good: and were men and women all as faithful
to themselves, as this divine reprover is to them, they would
all witness the blessing of peace; and if they held out in
faithfulness and obedience to the end, the answer of “well done,
thou good and faithful servant”, would be the happy portion of
them all.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended our meeting in silence.</p>

<p>First day, the 9th. Had the company of two female Friends
from Philadelphia, who were travelling in the ministry, at our
meeting. It proved a hard trying season: one of them was
exercised in public testimony, and although she appeared to
labour fervently, yet but little life was felt to arise during the
meeting. This makes the work hard for the poor exercised
ministers, who feel the necessity publicly to advocate the cause
of truth and righteousness, and yet obtain but little relief, by
reason of the deadness and indifference of those to whom they
are constrained to minister. I found it my place to sit silent,
and suffer with the seed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[Pg 272]</span></p>

<p>Second day. Went to New-York, in order to attend our
meeting for sufferings, which was held the next day at the ninth
hour in the morning. I accordingly attended, and returned home
that afternoon.</p>

<p>The rest of the week I spent about home. Attended our preparative
meeting on fifth day. The meeting for worship was
held in silence, and was a hard trying meeting.</p>

<p class="chap-head">Engagements at and about home, and within Westbury quarterly meeting, 1816
and 1817.</p>


<p>First day, the 16th of 6th month, 1816. My wife being
under an appointment to meet some women Friends at Bethpage
meeting, I accompanied her thither. It proved an exercising
meeting, especially in the forepart; but as I submitted
cheerfully and patiently to endure the present baptism, which,
indeed, as the experienced Paul well observes, is being baptized
for the dead, towards the latter part of the meeting, that all-quickening
and vivifying power that raises the dead to life, was
felt gradually to arise, by which my mind was quickened and
led to minister to the states of many present. Life spread over
the meeting tendering many hearts, and we parted under a grateful
sense of the Lord’s mercies; so that indeed the query of the
royal Psalmist is worthy to be had in continual remembrance:
“What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits towards
me?”</p>

<p>Spent the rest of this week about home. Attended our monthly
meeting on fifth day, but nothing unusual transpired.</p>

<p>First day, the 23d. Had the company of our friend Mary
Post from Westbury, she being engaged in a visit to the families
of Friends in our monthly meeting, a very useful service when
rightly entered into. My mind in this meeting, was brought
under exercise, in the remembrance of the following exhortation
of the wise king Solomon, viz: “Keep thy heart with all
diligence, for out of it are the issues of life.” From a consideration
of which, I was led to believe there was a very great want
of care among people generally, in duly guarding their rising<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[Pg 274]</span>
cogitations and thoughts, as it is the avenue by which all temptations
enter, and get place in the mind; and, if suited to our
natural propensities, too often overcome and lead to undue conduct.
The subject spread on my mind, and led to an impressive,
and, I trust, to some, an instructive communication; for which
my mind was made gratefully thankful to the Author of every
blessing.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Had the company of our aforesaid Friend at our
meeting to-day, whose simple and plain communication, tended
to quicken. A comfortable degree of life accompanied my mind
during the meeting, which I accounted a favour, having for some
time past witnessed much poverty of spirit in our meetings. The
rest of the week I attended to my temporal concerns, as much as
my state of health permitted; but being much indisposed with
bodily pain, it was but little I could do, except to take some oversight
of my business. This I consider one, among many other
such like mementos, to remind me of the approach of my bodily
dissolution. Be attentive, O my soul! that so thou mayest be in
a state of readiness when the midnight cry is heard: “Behold
the bridegroom cometh.”</p>

<p>First day, the 30th. My mind was led into close exercise and
travail, in the prospect of the very great apparent want of truth
and justice among the generality of the professors of Christianity,
even of the foremost classes of the different sects. The subject
spread and opened to communication, in which the attention of
the auditory was impressively called to the subject, as one of the
greatest moment, both in respect to our temporal, and, in a very
especial manner, our spiritual good; as every other virtue must
fail, and prove abortive, where truth and justice are wanting.</p>

<p>The rest of this week passed away without any thing worthy
of remark, except great poverty of spirit being almost continually
my attendant.</p>

<p>First day, the 7th of 7th month. My mind was opened and
enlarged in communication in our meeting to-day, on the subject
of the universal love of God to the children of men. For he not
only extends his gracious call to all, but causes them to hear it;
yet, agreeably to that scripture testimony, “all have not obeyed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[Pg 275]</span>
the gospel.” There are also many other plain testimonies in the
scriptures of the same import; clearly showing, that man’s destruction
and misery is altogether the result of his own misconduct,
and disobedience to divine requisition, without any necessity laid
upon him by his gracious Creator to err, or to swerve from the
path of rectitude; so that the Lord will be clear of the blood of
all his rational creation, as saith the prophet: “O Israel, thou
hast destroyed thyself, but in me is thy help;” and there are
many other passages which express the same. My mind was
led to open these subjects in a clear manner to the people, and to
show that the want of a right faith in God and Christ, as inwardly
revealed, was one of the greatest obstacles to their living
a just and righteous life in the sight of their Creator, as the just
can only live by faith. The meeting was large, and many hearts
were convicted, comforted and contrited; to the Lord only belongs
all the praise, nothing due to man but blushing and confusion
of face.</p>

<p>In the course of this week I was much unwell, forewarning me
that my glass is almost run, and my day of labour drawing to a
close. My indisposition prevented my attending our preparative
meeting on fifth day. These things all unitedly conspire to sound
forth this language, <i>remember to die</i>. Oh that I might witness
with the worthy Paul, more and more a daily death, to every thing
that tends to hinder my steady walking in the path of duty, that
so my day’s work may be finished in the day time.</p>

<p>First day, the 14th. Having so far recovered from my indisposition
as to get to our meeting to-day, my mind was opened in a
living powerful testimony to the excellency of the gospel <span class="correction" title="In the original book: dispenpensation">dispensation</span>,
in which Christ by his light and spirit was come to
teach his people himself; a Teacher not to be removed into a
corner, a Shepherd ever present to lead and feed all his sheep
that hear his voice and follow him; and do not follow the stranger,
nor listen to the voice of any outward hireling teachers,
although they charm ever so wisely. It was a season of favour,
and many hearts were warmed and contrited by the prevalence
of truth, and the Lord’s name was praised, who is over all worthy
for ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[Pg 276]</span></p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended our monthly meeting, at which the
queries were read and answers prepared to go to the quarterly
meeting. To judge from these, it would appear that we were
generally an upright people; but I fear our answers are becoming
too much like many of us, more in show and outside appearance,
than in spirit and substance. For by this formal way of answering
them, unless great care is taken, our queries may do us much
more harm than good; and this fear often attends my mind, and
induces me to call the attention of my friends from the letter of
discipline, to the spirit and substance; without which all letter
and outward order, however beautiful in the outward appearance,
is but as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal, and will in the
end only deceive and disappoint us, and unveil our nakedness.</p>

<p>Sixth day. Was our preparative meeting of Ministers and
Elders, in which our answers made a similar appearance; insomuch,
that there was but little to find fault with. I hope it may
stand the test in the day of trial; this we ought carefully to consider,
otherwise, in the end, we may fall short when it may be
too late to retrieve the loss.</p>

<p>The rest of the week I attended to my temporal business as far
as my bodily infirmity would permit, although at times my exercise
produced very acute pains. I find it needful however, to
keep up a continual watch, that I do nothing to promote or encourage
idleness, that bane to every Christian virtue; and especially
at such a time as this, when most of our capable well-looking
young men are running into cities and populous towns
to engage in merchandise, or some other calling by which they
may live by their wits, being unwilling to labour with their
hands: although it is the most sure way marked out by divine
wisdom for our truest comfort and peace here, and a right preparation
for eternal joy hereafter. And, although many fatal
consequences have befallen many of those who have thus run
out in trade and mercantile business, apparently to the ruin of
both body and soul, and the great injury and distress of their
families: yet, because some few have made themselves rich in
temporal things by those pursuits, it has so blinded the minds of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[Pg 277]</span>
many that they will not take warning, but go on in their wilful
way to their own utter ruin.</p>

<p>First day, the 21st. This day at our meeting, my mouth was
opened in a full testimony introduced by this scripture passage:
“Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking
heed thereto according to thy word.” I was led in my communication
to show to the people, that in this word was comprehended
the great gospel privilege, the word nigh in the heart and
in the mouth; and that it was not a <i>literal or outward word</i>,
nor any created thing, but the <i>uncreated word</i>, <i>Christ</i>, by whom
all things were created, or at first spoke into existence and order.
For nothing else could enable us to cleanse our way, or live a
righteous holy life; and that it was only by a living faith in this
inward, operative, powerful word, that any could please God or
be acceptable to him, and was the only means by which we
could be saved: and that it was offered to the acceptance of all,
and therefore all were encouraged to lay hold of the offered mercy,
and not slight the day of their visitation.</p>

<p>Second and third days. I was busied in overseeing my temporal
business, attended, at times, by much bodily pain; and
which, I trust and hope, I endured without improperly complaining
or murmuring. The three following days, I attended our
quarterly meeting, held this time at Westbury. I think, in the
main, it was a favoured season. The meeting was large and
solemn: the divine presence and power were evidently felt to
preside, humbling many minds and producing contrition of spirit,
and the gospel labours were instructive and edifying.</p>

<p>First day, the 28th. A quiet day. Sat our meeting in
silence.</p>

<p>Fifth day. A silent meeting. The rest of the week, as to
bodily exercise, mostly occupied in my temporal affairs.</p>

<p>First day, the 4th of 8th month. My mind settled in quiet
with the exercise of this day. Besides the usual care and
industry necessary in my temporal concerns, that all things might
be rightly arranged, I attended, in the course of this week, our
preparative meeting on fifth day, and the funeral of a deceased
neighbour on sixth day. At the funeral was a large promiscuous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[Pg 278]</span>
assembly, amongst whom my mouth was opened in a large
searching testimony, suiting the occasion; whereby many hearts
were tendered, and much brokenness appeared in the meeting.
The truth delivered being brought home to the consciences of
many, by the prevalence of the divine power, which was eminently
in dominion over all.</p>

<p>First day, the 11th. I trust the exercise and travail of our
meeting to-day tended to profit.</p>

<p>Second day. I attended the funeral of our friend Edmund
Pearsall, of Flushing. His corpse was carried into the meeting-house
there; and a large solid meeting was held on the occasion.</p>

<p>Third day. I attended our meeting for sufferings in New-York,
which, I think, was an instructive season.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended our monthly meeting, in which I
opened to Friends a prospect, which had for several months
attended my mind, to pay a religious visit to the bordering
inhabitants of our quarterly meeting; and had their unity
therein.</p>

<p>Sixth and seventh days. I spent in my usual avocations.</p>

<p>First day, the 18th. My mind, as I sat in our meeting, was
opened into a view of the great benefits, and supreme felicity,
which man derives, and only can derive, from the true knowledge
and right fear of his Creator; and which knowledge and
fear no man can witness or have experience of, but by the revelation
of the spirit of God, or by the aid of that light, which
Jesus Christ told the Jews was the condemnation of the world, or
of all those who did not believe in and obey it; and which is an
<i>inward</i> and not an <i>outward light</i>; and all its manifestations
are in the mind or heart of man. I was led to show to the
people, that this doctrine was altogether the most rational, and
such as no man of right reason could doubt or dispute. I hope
the season was instructive to some, and might tend to remove
doubts from some doubting minds, as, from the sensations which
I had, I was led to believe there were some such present.</p>

<p>Second, third, and fourth days. I attended to my temporal
concerns, clothed with much poverty of spirit; yet, not altogether
cast down nor discouraged, respecting my spiritual welfare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[Pg 279]</span></p>

<p>Fifth day. A silent quiet meeting.</p>

<p>Sixth and seventh days. Paid some attention to my temporal
business, although, at times, in much bodily pain, which, more
or less, attends me daily, and has for several months past.</p>

<p>First day, the 25th. According to the prospect opened at our
last monthly meeting, I attended two appointed meetings in the
neighbouring town of Hempstead; one in the morning, at the
eleventh hour, at the house of Samuel Carman, a person inclining
to Friends, and the other at the fourth hour in the afternoon, at
John Raynor’s, about four miles distant from the former, he also
being kind and well disposed towards Friends.</p>

<p>These were both pretty full meetings, there being as many
people as the rooms could well accommodate. Through the
gracious condescension of the Shepherd of Israel, the word went
forth freely among them, in a full impressive testimony at each
place, tendering and contriting many hearts, and to the increase
of love to the truth, and to the promoters of it. I took my leave
of them in the fresh feelings of mutual Christian affection, and
returned home that evening with a quiet peaceful mind, the assured
reward of faithfulness.</p>

<p>The rest of the week I spent in my usual avocations, not omitting
the attendance of our meeting on fifth day, which I sat in
silence.</p>

<p>First day, the 1st of 9th month. I attended an appointed
meeting among my relatives and acquaintance at Rockaway,
the place of my former residence, when young, while living in
my father’s house. The meeting was not large, but proved a
precious tendering season. Many hearts were much broken and
contrited by the prevalence of divine love and power that accompanied
the testimony borne, and spread generally over the meeting,
to the praise of His grace who is calling us to glory and
virtue.</p>

<p>A concern for the guarded education of the youth among
Friends has for many years past exercised our yearly meeting;
and many advices and recommendations have been issued therefrom
to the quarterly and other subordinate meetings, in order to
stir up Friends to vigilance and care therein, that proper schools<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[Pg 280]</span>
might be established among them, under the care of pious tutors,
that so Friends’ children, while getting their necessary school
learning, might be religiously instructed, and preserved from
evil examples, and the company of such children as are viciously
inclined; by which their tender minds might be wounded, and
led from the simplicity of truth. In order further to stir up
Friends to this concern, our last yearly meeting directed the
quarterly meetings to appoint committees to visit the monthly
and preparative meetings, to encourage Friends therein. As I
was one among other Friends appointed by our quarterly meeting
for that purpose, we attended the monthly meetings of New-York
and Flushing, in the course of this week. And I am
thankful in believing that the service was owned by the Head of
the Church, who was graciously near, and furnished with matter
suited to the occasion; insomuch, that I have cause to believe
that the opportunities at each place were instructive and edifying,
affording encouragement to the willing-minded.</p>

<p>First day, the 8th of 9th month. I found it my place to be at
home to-day, and of course attended our own meeting. Although
most of the forepart of the meeting, I apprehended I should
be permitted to sit it in silence; yet about the middle thereof,
my mind was quickened in the remembrance of the testimony
of Solomon, where he tells us, that “Wisdom is the
principal thing.” As the subject spread on my mind, I was led
to consider how it is that all men speak highly of it, and yet, at the
same time, are not at all rightly acquainted with its beginning;
and are therefore mostly living all their days without the right
knowledge of, and acquaintance with it. For it is not to be
derived through any other medium than the true fear of the
Lord, which we are told is the beginning of wisdom; and as it
is only begun in man by this true fear, so likewise it is the middle
and the end; as every advancement in true wisdom is only by
the fear of the Lord: surely, then, it is the most precious of any
thing to the children of men.</p>

<p>I spent the rest of the week about home. Attended our preparative
meeting on fifth day. The meeting for worship was
held in silence. Our yearly meeting’s minute of advice on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[Pg 281]</span>
subject of schools was at this time received; but as it was expected
that the quarterly meeting’s committee, on that subject, would
shortly attend the preparative meeting, the consideration thereof
was deferred to the time of their attendance.</p>

<p>First day, the 15th. By appointment I attended two meetings;
one at Cold Spring at ten o’clock in the morning, and the other
in Friends’ meeting-house at Oysterbay, at the third hour in the
afternoon. Both were pretty well attended by the neighbouring
inhabitants, among whom I was helped to preach the gospel in
the demonstration of the spirit, accompanied with such a degree
of the Lord’s power and presence, as to produce a precious solemnity
over the assemblies, especially the latter, wherein many
truths of the gospel were largely opened, humbling and contriting
the hearts of a number present. Surely it was the Lord’s doing,
to whom all the praise and glory are, and ought to be ascribed,
both now and for ever.</p>

<p>In the course of this week, I attended our own and Westbury
monthly meeting, in company with the quarterly meeting’s committee,
on the subject of schools. These were both favoured
opportunities. The concern was opened in a very impressive
manner, and spread weightily over the meetings, the men and
women sitting together while this subject was before them. And
I have a hope that Friends will be strengthened and encouraged
to persevere in the concern, and keep it on its right basis, that is,
a concern for the religious and moral instruction of our youth,
while at school, by placing them under the care of pious tutors,
who may co-operate with the endeavours of religiously concerned
parents, who are more desirous that their children may be brought
up and educated in the fear of the Lord, and in his nurture and
admonition, than that they should make great advancements in
scholastic science, or obtain the riches and popularity of the
world; all of which are of momentary duration, and unworthy
of much of the care of a rational immortal being, especially when
compared with the blessings attendant on a truly moral and
religious life, and walking in the fear of the Lord.</p>

<p>First day, the 22d. In prosecution of the concern I had
engaged in to visit the neighbouring inhabitants, notice was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[Pg 282]</span>
sent to Friends of Martinicock, that I proposed to attend their
meeting at this time; and desiring that public notice might be
given to their neighbours who were not members, it was accordingly
done. By this means the meeting was very large, more
so than I had ever seen it before; among whom I was helped to
labour in the cause of the gospel, opening many important scripture
passages, tending to elucidate and confirm many points of
our doctrine and principles, to my own, and apparently to the
general satisfaction of the assembly. At three o’clock in the
afternoon I attended another meeting at Moscheto Cove, held in
the house of the widow Hannah Valentine. This was also a
large favoured meeting, in which many truths of the gospel were
clearly and satisfactorily opened. I returned home that evening
with peace of mind, from an inward sense that I had faithfully
discharged myself among the people, concerning the things which
relate to their salvation.</p>

<p>The rest of the week I was at and about home, attending to
my usual occupations. Sat our fifth day meeting in silence.</p>

<p>First day, the 29th. I attended Friends’ meeting at Cowneck;
and previous notice having been sent of my intention to be
there, the meeting was large, and favoured in a good degree with
the overshadowing of the divine presence, enabling to preach the
gospel in the demonstration of the spirit, and with power; breaking
and contriting many hearts. At the third hour in the afternoon,
by previous appointment, had a meeting at Hempstead
Harbour, at the house of Daniel Robbins. This was rather a
hard exercising meeting, yet, I trust, in the main a profitable
season.</p>

<p>The following part of the week I spent mostly in the oversight
of my farming business. Sat our fifth day meeting again in
silence, at which we had the company of our Friends Isaac
Martin and Henry Shotwell, from Jersey.</p>

<p>First day, the 6th of 10th month. Attended our meeting in
silence. It was in the main, I think, a weighty, solemn season.
At three o’clock in the afternoon, I had an appointed meeting in
the neighbourhood for the people of colour. It was held in one
of their houses, and was a season of favour. I hope it may prove<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[Pg 283]</span>
profitable to them. For this portion of dedication to duty in the
cause of righteousness, I felt peace in my own mind.</p>

<p>Second day. A Friend from the western part of this state,
being on a religious visit among us, had an appointed meeting at
our place at the eleventh hour. It proved a comfortable edifying
season. After this I rode to New-York in order to attend our
meeting for sufferings, held the next day at the ninth hour. In
the course of the business that came before us, the meeting was
led into an exercise, on behalf of that portion of the descendants
of the Africans who are still held in bondage in our state. A
proposition was made for addressing our state legislature on their
account, in order, if possible, to obtain a law for their emancipation;
apprehending, that as the greater part of these long-oppressed
people had now obtained their freedom, those who were still held,
felt their condition much more aggravating, and their bondage
more intolerable; insomuch, that it appeared to us altogether
just and consistent with the duty of the legislature, to restore to
them the just right of freedom. After due consideration, the
proposition was acceded to, and a committee named to draft an
essay of an address accordingly.</p>

<p>Fifth day. This being our preparative meeting, in which our
queries were read, and answers prepared to go to the quarterly
meeting. I felt my mind exercised on account of the many
deficiencies apparent, particularly in the non-attendance of our
religious meetings, as a failure in that often leads to greater
deficiencies in other respects.</p>

<p>First day, the 13th. My mind was pretty largely opened in
testimony to the sufficiency of the divine light. The season was
solemn, and I hope instructive and profitable to many present.</p>

<p>At three o’clock in the afternoon, I attended an appointed
meeting in Woolver Hollow, a neighbourhood composed mostly
of the descendants of the Dutch. The season was instructive,
and tending to edification; and I parted with them under an
humbling sense of the favour.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Our monthly meeting being held at this time,
answers were received from our preparative meetings, to the five
queries usually answered, in which divers deficiencies were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[Pg 284]</span>
stated; but this being frequently the case, it produced little or no
concern to the greater portion of the members; and I have been
afraid at times, that the queries would become a snare to us, and
prove rather hurtful than helpful.</p>

<p>First day, the 20th. Had a conflicting season in the forepart
of our meeting to-day with a worldly spirit, and the benumbing
consequences of a desire after riches. And while labouring under
a feeling of these states, with their stupifying effects, which
were even intolerable to bear, it often ran through my mind, that
“the cares of the world, the deceitfulness of riches,” and the lust
of other things, like briars and thorns, choke the good seed and
prevent its growth. And as I continued patiently under the
labour, towards the close of the meeting light sprang up and dispelled
the darkness; in which strength and ability were dispensed
to communicate in a lively and clear manner, showing the pernicious
effects of those things, wherever they obtained the ascendency
in the minds of men and women; elucidating the subject
by the parable of our Lord, concerning the rich man and Lazarus
the beggar. It was, I believe, a season of real instruction to
some present, which I hope may not be soon forgotten.</p>

<p>At three o’clock in the afternoon, I attended a meeting I had
previously appointed in a neighbouring village. It proved a
satisfactory season to my own mind, and generally so, I believe,
to all who attended. These favours are not to be lightly esteemed,
but held in grateful remembrance.</p>

<p>In the course of this week was our quarterly meeting, held at
this time at Flushing. Although some of the sittings were exercising
and arduous, yet in the main, I think, it was a favoured
edifying season; and we parted at the close of the public meeting
on sixth day, under a thankful sense that the Shepherd of Israel
had not forsaken his people, but was still graciously near, a present
helper to all his faithful and devoted children. In the course
of this meeting, on the evening of fifth day, I had an appointed
meeting in the town of Jamaica, among those not in profession
with us, which proved a very satisfactory season. The people’s
minds appeared to be gathered into true stillness, a situation most
suitable to be taught and instructed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[Pg 285]</span></p>

<p>First day, the 27th. Sat our meeting mostly in silence, but
towards the close my mind was opened and led to communicate a
short, but lively testimony, which was introduced by the greatest
part of the first psalm of David: in the opening of which, the
meeting appeared generally to be gathered into a sweet, comfortable
solemnity, and we parted under a solemn sense of the unmerited
favour.</p>

<p>In the course of this week, I attended, in company with most
of the committee of the quarterly meeting on the concern relative
to schools, the two preparative meetings in New-York, and that
at Flushing; also an appointed meeting at Brooklyn on third day
evening, and one at Newtown on fifth day evening. The last
was a very instructive favoured meeting.</p>

<p>First day, the 3d of 11th month. Sat our meeting to-day
altogether in silence. Spent the rest of the week principally in
attention to my temporal concerns, which I believe to be a
Christian’s reasonable duty; except that I attended in company
with some of the quarterly meeting’s committee on fifth day, the
preparative meeting at Cowneck. I sat the meeting for worship
in silent suffering; but was led in the preparative meeting, pretty
largely to open the nature and design of the concern of the yearly
meeting, with regard to the pious and guarded education of the
youth of our society, particularly while young and at school, in
getting their necessary school learning; that they might as much
as possible, be kept out of harm’s way, by being placed at schools
under the care of pious religiously concerned persons, members
in society; who would be likely to co-operate with the religious
concern of their parents, in endeavouring, as much as might be,
to bring them up agreeably to apostolic exhortation: “In the nurture
and admonition of the Lord.” For there is nothing that can
more nearly and necessarily engage the minds of rightly exercised
parents, next to their own souls, than the religious welfare of their
children: for parents who can live in the neglect of this great
and incumbent duty, must be dead to every right exercise and
concern for the preservation and everlasting welfare of their tender
offspring.</p>

<p>First day, the 10th. Sat our meeting in silence: then rode<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[Pg 286]</span>
several miles to visit a person who was sick, and returned the
next day.</p>

<p>I had to reflect on the great and serious loss sustained by a
large portion of mankind, from the want of due attention and a
right perseverance in the way of known duty while young in
years; that when they are advanced in age, and bodily infirmities
interfere and increase upon them, they are tossed up and
down in their minds, and can find no sure place of refuge for
their souls; like a ship in the midst of the ocean without a helm,
and which can find no safe anchoring ground.</p>

<p>On fourth day attended the funeral of a young woman on
Cowneck, who was taken away very suddenly, with about three
hour’s illness. I had an open time among the people that were
assembled on this solemn occasion, and was led to call their
attention to the propriety and necessity of an early preparation
for death; and to show that it manifested great presumption in
such a poor impotent creature as man, who was so sensible of the
uncertainty of time, to dare to lay his head down at night to
take his natural rest, without knowing his peace made with his
God.</p>

<p>Fifth and sixth days. Attended, in company with some of the
committee of the quarterly meeting on the subject of schools, the
preparative meetings of Martinicock and Bethpage; both of which
were open favoured seasons, while the subject of our appointment
was under consideration.</p>

<p>On seventh day I attended the funeral of a very aged man of
my acquaintance, being upwards of ninety years old, who lived
in the town of Hempstead. There was a pretty large collection
of the neighbouring inhabitants present, among whom I was led
and strengthened to open divers necessary and important doctrines
of the gospel, in the clear demonstration of the spirit; and,
I trust and hope, to the edification and religious instruction of
many present. Surely it was the Lord’s doing, and to him belongs
all the praise and honour of his own works, and nothing
due to man.</p>

<p>First day, the 17th. Sat our meeting in silence. It was a
quiet solid season. The rest of the week I was occupied in my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[Pg 287]</span>
husbandry business, except attending our monthly meeting on
fifth day.</p>

<p>First day, the 24th. My mind in our meeting to-day, was
led into an humbling exercise, under a sensible view of the great
ascendency of evil over the good among mankind in general, not
excepting the best regulated society among men. I was also led,
under the saddening prospect, to communicate to the meeting
the feeling impressions of my mind thereon, together with the
causes of this great degeneracy from the simplicity of the gospel
of Christ; and that it was the effect of a spirit of ease and carnal
security, and being led and governed in our conduct and works
by custom and tradition, without taking the pains to examine
whether they were founded in truth and righteousness or not;
and when at times they are awakened by the convicting evidence
of truth on the mind, instead of willingly submitting thereto,
they call to their aid all the powers of their reasoning faculties to
drown the reprover’s voice, that so they may rest secure in their
ceiled houses. Alas for these in the trying hour of final decision!
how dreadfully saddening will be their prospects in a dying
hour!</p>

<p>First day, the 1st of 12th month. I sat with Friends at Westbury.
The meeting was for the most part a dull exercising season;
but towards the close I had a short testimony given me to
communicate, in which the state of the meeting was so opened
as to have a very reaching effect on most present; which spread
life over the meeting, and much tenderness and contrition were
apparent. Surely have we not cause for these favours, often to
say with one formerly: “What shall I render unto the Lord for
all his benefits towards me.”</p>

<p>Second day. I attended the funeral of a near kinsman at Far
Rockaway, at which I had a very open time amongst the people
collected on that solemn occasion.</p>

<p>I returned home on third day, and the weather being cold and
inclement I was indisposed for several days after, which prevented
my attending our meeting on fifth day; a circumstance which
very seldom happens, as I am generally preserved in the enjoyment
of such a state of health, as to attend meetings when at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[Pg 288]</span>
home without much omission: and which I consider as one
among many especial blessings and favours, dispensed by a kind
and beneficent Providence to me, a poor unworthy creature.</p>

<p>First day, the 8th. I left home this morning and rode to New-York,
and attended Friends’ meeting at Pearl-street in the afternoon,
in which I had to suffer, being dipped into a state of death.
I felt as though baptized for the dead, but as I patiently endured
I was helped towards the close to spread my exercise before the
meeting, and a degree of life was felt to arise, and some were
quickened, but with too many there appeared to be a great want
of a right inward engagement and travail of spirit, and these
were sent empty away.</p>

<p>I tarried in town until fourth day, it being the time of our
meeting for sufferings. In the course of this meeting, we prepared
a memorial to lay before the legislature of our state, on
behalf of the black people still held in bondage among us. A
committee was separated to attend therewith, and we have a hope
that it may prove effectual for their relief.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended our preparative meeting, and had to
spread before my Friends the exercise of my mind, on account
of the neglect of too many among us in respect to the due observance
of discipline; which is a source of great weakness to society,
and especially so to those who are delinquent.</p>

<p>Sixth and seventh days. Spent in my usual vocations, accompanied
with quietness and peace of mind.</p>

<p>First day, the 15th. Almost as soon as I had taken my seat
in our meeting to-day, there was brought to my remembrance
the following exhortation of the apostle, accompanied with a
degree of life: “To do good, and to communicate, forget not.”
As I quietly attended to the impression, it led to communication
and opened to a field of doctrine, tending to show the indispensable
obligation every real Christian lies under, let his allotment in the
Church or in the world at large be what it may, to comply
therewith, it being a divine requisition. It is therefore reasonable
to suppose that by a life of steady and uniform industry, and
from which man derives great earthly felicity, and through the
divine blessing, most individuals would be enabled to fulfil the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[Pg 289]</span>
obligation; by which means all the misery and distress that arise
from poverty and want would be done away from the Church of
Christ, and agreeably to the prophecy of Isaiah, no wasting or
destruction be found within her borders; and Christians would
witness in their own experience, that it is more blessed to give
than to receive; as we should thereby approach nearer to our
divine original, from whom we receive every blessing both spiritual
and temporal.</p>

<p>The following part of the week I spent in my usual occupations,
except attending our monthly meeting on fifth day.</p>

<p>First day, the 22d. This day I attended the funeral of my
brother Stephen Hicks at Rockaway. There was a pretty large
collection of people on the occasion, among whom I was led to
labour fervently in the gospel, and largely to declare of the things
concerning the kingdom of God. The season was solemn, and
by the prevalence of the divine power that attended, many hearts
were contrited and a precious solemnity was spread over the
assembly, worthy of our deepest gratitude and thankfulness of
heart. I returned home that evening with sweet peace of mind.</p>

<p>Having for some time felt a draft on my mind to appoint a
few meetings in some adjacent neighbourhoods, to the south and
east of us, I left home on the seventh day of this week, accompanied
by my neighbour Jacob Willits, jr. We rode that afternoon
to our friend James Rushmore’s, at the Half-way Hollow Hills;
where, by previous notice, we had a comfortable satisfactory
meeting in the evening, mostly made up of those not in membership
with us. The next day, the first of the week, we had two
meetings; one in the town of Islip in the morning, at the residence
of my son-in-law Joshua Willits, the other at the third
hour in the afternoon, in the school-house at the village of Babylon.
These were very solemn affecting meetings, wherein many
truths of the gospel were largely and livingly opened, in the
demonstration of the spirit, attended with a power that humbled
and contrited many hearts, and brought a general solemnity over
the meetings.</p>

<p>The next day we rode to our friend Thomas Whitson’s, on
the south side of our township. Had an appointed meeting there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[Pg 290]</span>
that evening, which was also favoured with attendant gospel
power; whereby my mind was opened and led to sound forth an
arousing testimony, in order to stir up many present, who, for
want of faithfulness and obedience to manifested duty, were
much behind in their day’s work: and which, as it opened on my
mind, I expressed to them to be not only a cause of great loss
and disadvantage in a religious sense to themselves, but also to
their families and their tender offspring. Things were laid close
home to these, and they excited to more faithfulness and religious
engagement.</p>

<p>At this place I was informed of the death of our Friend and
neighbour Elizabeth Jones, wife of Samuel Jones, whose funeral
was to be the next day. This information induced us to return
home early in the morning in order to attend the same. As she
had many connexions, there was a very large collection of people
on the occasion, many of whom were of divers persuasions. My
heart and mouth were opened to preach the gospel among them,
and to explain to the people the principles of the Christian religion,
in a full and clear manner, in the authority of truth. It
was a highly favoured season, in which truth reigned triumphant;
and the Lord’s name and power were praised and exalted
over all.</p>

<p>Fifth day, the 2d of 1st month, 1817. I attended our meeting
as usual. It was quiet and comfortable. Near the close I
had a short testimony to communicate, to the excellency and
exalted privileges of the Christian state, which brought a precious
covering over the <span class="correction" title="In the original book: meeeting">meeting</span>.</p>

<p>First day, the 5th. Very soon after I took my seat in meeting
to-day, my mind was brought into a feeling sense and view of
the superiour excellency of the true Christian religion; and this
can only be known and possessed by a full and entire subjugation
of our wills to the divine will, and living in the practical
part of that reasonable injunction of our blessed Lord, to seek
first the kingdom of God and his righteousness; then every
other blessing that is needful and comfortable for us will be
added, in the openings of the divine counsel. But alas, how few
there are who pay any right attention to this excellent requisition,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[Pg 291]</span>
but on the contrary go on in their own wills, and in the prosecution
of their own schemes of profit and pleasure, most generally
at least until they marry, and settle themselves in the care and
concerns of a family. In all this time, scarcely one in ten thousand
of the human family even think of seeking first the kingdom
of God and his righteousness, or even asking counsel of
him in the weighty concern of marriage; upon a right procedure
in which, their present and future happiness greatly depend, and
for want of this previous care, they are often very unequally yoked
together; and when these have a family of children about them,
without any right ability and qualification to instruct them, confusion
and disorder ensue; and the poor children are left to grow
up without right cultivation, as brambles in the wilderness, a
lamentable case indeed: a view of which has often clothed my
mind with mourning. I was led largely to open these subjects
to the meeting under the influence of gospel love, and
found peace in my labour, the sure reward of faithfulness to
manifested duty; and whether the people will hear or forbear, it
is not the business of the instrument to be careful about, as the
word that goeth forth will not return void, but will accomplish the
thing whereto it is sent; either to instruct and comfort, or to
reprove and condemn.</p>

<p>The rest of the week I was mostly employed in my temporal
concerns, except attending our preparative meeting on fifth day.
The meeting for worship was, I think, a favoured season.</p>

<p>First day the 12th. A silent meeting to-day.</p>

<p>Fourth day. Feeling my mind drawn to attend the monthly
meeting of Westbury, which was held to-day, I proceeded accordingly.
In the meeting for worship, I was led to show to Friends,
under the similitude of Israel’s travel, that it was not enough to
be delivered from our former sins, nor from the red sea of trials
and obstructing temptations, so as to rejoice on the banks of deliverance,
and be fed with heavenly manna, even angels’ food; nor
to journey on towards the promised Canaan, as far as Korah and
his company; and to see like them, the wonder-working power
of Jehovah in the wilderness, unless they also came to witness a
complete death to their own wills, so as to be entirely submis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[Pg 292]</span>sive
to the will of our heavenly Father; for otherwise they would
be left to encompass as it were, a mountain in the wilderness, until
the old man, that is, self-will, is entirely worn out and dies there,
on this side Jordan: for nothing short of that will open Jordan’s
streams, and enable us to go through on dry land. I had largely
to open to Friends the mystery of our redemption, in the demonstration
of the spirit, showing the necessity of continual perseverance
and making progress in our heavenly journey, otherwise
we shall be liable to fall into a state of ease and carnal security;
and thereby make shipwreck of faith and a good conscience, and
our latter end be worse than the beginning; like those of Israel,
who fell in the wilderness and never obtained the promised land.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended our monthly meeting. As it was the
time of answering our queries, I was engaged to stir up Friends
to more diligence, by faithfully scrutinizing their own individual
states through the medium of the queries, by which means they
would be truly useful to us; for otherwise the reading and answering
them would become a dead lifeless form.</p>

<p>First day, the 19th. A silent meeting to-day, in which my
spirit was grieved, as is too often the case in our meetings, from
a sense of the great want of real spiritual life, and the apparent
deadness and formality which too generally prevail; whereby it
often happens that a number appear drowsy and nodding, and
some falling asleep, to the great trouble and exercise of the living
concerned members, who are often led to mourn in secret on these
accounts.</p>

<p>In the course of this week I attended our quarterly meeting
held at this time at Westbury. It was a season of close solemn
searching, and through the animating influence of the divine
light and life, the hidden things of Esau or the first nature, were
brought to light and judged. Although some, who had long
covered themselves as with thick clay, and were solacing themselves
in their ceiled houses, kicked like Jeshurun of old, when
they were made to feel the piercing edge of that sword which
divides between soul and spirit, joints and marrow, and is a
discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart; yet the truth
had its way over all their opposition, and in the closing meeting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[Pg 293]</span>
reigned triumphant over all. Blessed be the Lord for his unspeakable
gifts dispensed to his faithful children.</p>

<p>First day, the 26th. My mind in our meeting to-day, was
led to reflect on the excellency and powerful effect of true faith.
As the subject opened, I found it my place to spread the prospect
before the meeting; in the communication whereof, life sprang
up and the truth was raised into dominion over all, and my heart
was made thankful for the unmerited favour.</p>

<p>The rest of the week I was busily employed in my domestic
affairs, and in taking the oversight and care of my stock; the
weather being very cold and frosty, and the earth covered with
snow. Attended our meeting on fifth day, at which there was
a funeral of a deceased Friend, an ancient maiden. I sat the
greater part of the meeting in silence, in which time there were
two short testimonies delivered, but without much apparent
effect, as the seed of immortal life was too much pressed down,
as a cart with sheaves; and nothing is sufficient to raise a meeting
from such a state of death and stupor, but the life-giving
presence and powerful word of Him, who raised Lazarus from
the grave. As I patiently endured the necessary baptism for the
dead, towards the close of the meeting a little gleam of light
appeared, in which was brought to my remembrance that passage
of the wise man, that “Righteousness exalteth a nation.”
And as my inward eye was kept to the opening, it spread, and
light sprang up, in which I felt the truth of that saying, that
“the Lord’s people are willing in the day of his power;” and as I
yielded to communication, the life was raised into dominion, and
ran as oil over all. Surely it was the Lord’s doing and marvellous
in mine eyes.</p>

<p class="chap-head">Engagements at and near home, 1817.&mdash;Visit to some parts of the yearly meetings
of Philadelphia and Baltimore, 1817.</p>


<p>First day, the 2d of 2d month, 1817. I was largely led
forth in our meeting to-day, on the different dispensations communicated
to man by his gracious Creator, in order for his
recovery out of the fall, and pointing out to the people the difference
between the law state and that of the gospel: showing that
the former was a mere figure or prelude to the latter, and that
the first, with all its elementary rituals, ceased where the latter
begun; the first only affecting the body, the latter principally
the soul; the first only the shadow of good things, the latter the
substance of all good to man; by which he is altogether redeemed
from sin and death, as he submits willingly and fully to the
power of the gospel, and is thereby prepared for an inheritance in
eternal life.</p>

<p>In the course of this week, besides giving the necessary attention
to my temporal affairs, I made several friendly visits to the
families of some particular friends, in company with my wife
and daughter Elizabeth. Although I met with some occurrences,
one in particular, which produced considerable exercise on my
mind, yet I had satisfaction in the visits; believing that when
they are properly made, they often prove mutually comfortable
and encouraging. Sat our meeting on fifth day in silence.</p>

<p>First day, the 9th. Had a silent meeting to-day. This week
afforded occasion of deep inward exercise, and seasons of heart-searching,
in a view of the manifest declension of many among
us from that honest simplicity and faithfulness which so eminently
characterized our worthy predecessors, as also the increase<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[Pg 295]</span>
of vanity and immorality among the people without; and
which I fear may have been increased by the want of faithfulness
among us, in the right and full support of our Christian
testimonies.</p>

<p>First day, the 16th. Soon after I took my seat in our meeting
to-day, my mind was quickened and led into a sympathetic
feeling with the state of Elijah, when he fled from the wrath and
persecution of Ahab and Jezebel, and when under great discouragement
and dismay he bemoaned his condition; saying, that
they had pulled down the Lord’s altars, slain his servants, and
he only was left and they sought his life; but the Lord told him
for his encouragement, that there were seven thousand yet left in
Israel, who had not bowed their knee to the image of Baal. But
these no doubt were so scattered and dispersed among the people,
that Elijah could scarcely find one to whom he might open his
mind, and therefore felt himself as one alone. This no doubt is
the lot of some of the Lord’s most faithful servants in the present
day, and was it not for the same divine help and succour that
Elijah experienced, some of these at times would be altogether
cast down and discouraged.</p>

<p>The subject spread and enlarged, and opened to a field of doctrine;
wherein I was led to show to the people that the mystery
of iniquity had wrought in and under every dispensation of God
to the Church through its varied transformations, and always
resembling as much as may be, an angel of light; by which it
lies in wait to deceive, and has generally deceived, and still deceives,
the greater part of the people of all the nations under
heaven; setting up its post by God’s post, and leading its votaries to
perform their worship and works just like the Lord’s servants, with
only this difference, that it is done in a way and time of their own
heart’s devising. But the Lord’s children are all taught of the
Lord, and they are made to know it; for in righteousness they
are established, and great is the peace of these children; and there
is no peace to the wicked, to such as walk in their own wills, and
in the way of their own heart’s devising.</p>

<p>On fifth day of this week, was our monthly meeting, at
which we had the company of a Friend in the ministry from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[Pg 296]</span>
one of our upper quarterly meetings. He preached the truth
to us in a pretty correct manner; but I thought I never saw,
with greater clearness than at this time, that ministers might
preach the literal truth, and yet not preach the real gospel:
and herein is witnessed the truth of that saying of the apostle,
that “the <i>letter</i>,” however true, “<i>killeth</i>;” “but the <i>spirit</i>,” and
the spirit only, “<i>giveth life</i>.” And it is a great thing when
ministers keep in remembrance that necessary caution of the
divine Master, not to premeditate what they shall say; but carefully
to wait in the nothingness and emptiness of self, that what
they speak may be only what the Holy Spirit speaketh in them;
then will they not only speak the truth, but the truth, accompanied
with power, and thereby profit the hearers.</p>

<p>First day, 23d. A silent meeting to-day. Nothing transpired
in the course of this week, which required particular notice. Sat
our meeting on fifth day in silence.</p>

<p>First day, the 2d of 3d month. Having felt my mind for
several weeks past drawn to visit Bethpage meeting, I rode
thither to-day in company with my wife. It was rather a low
dull time, but as I continued in the patience, a small prospect
opened on the excellency of justice, and the right bringing up of
children. It led to a communication instructive and edifying, for
which I was made thankful.</p>

<p>First day, the 9th. This day as I sat in our meeting, my
mind was led to view the exalted and precious state those enjoyed,
who were brought by their faithfulness to witness in themselves
the fulfilment of the first and great commandment, that of loving
God above all; as they would thereby likewise know the fulfilment
of the second, that of loving their neighbour as themselves.
As the subject spread on my mind I believed it right to express it
to the assembly, which brought a precious solemnity over the
meeting, and, I trust, it was an instructive season to some present.</p>

<p>This week principally spent in the care of my temporal concerns
and in lending assistance to the needy, and in the course
of which my mind was often attended with comforting ejaculations
after this manner. “The Lord is my strength and my song,
the lifter up of mine head and my salvation; therefore I will not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[Pg 297]</span>
fear what man can do unto me. He leadeth me about and
instructeth me, and preserveth me from the snare of the fowler,
and from the strife of tongues.”</p>

<p>First day, the 16th. Our meeting to-day was large and solemn,
and mostly silent. A little before the close, an exhortation of
the apostle Peter was brought before the view of my mind: “Be
sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring
lion, walketh about seeking whom he may devour.” As the
subject opened I found it my duty to spread it before the meeting,
with some observations thereon, tending to excite the people to
diligence, inasmuch as there could be no doubt of the truth of
the apostle’s testimony; hence it was necessary for each one to
keep the watch, resisting him steadfast in the faith. The communication
though short, was so attended with the quickening
power of the gospel, as to reach, affect, and tender many minds,
and brought a solemn awe over the meeting. Such seasons are
worthy of grateful acknowledgments to the blessed Author of all
our rich mercies.</p>

<p>Spent this week mostly at and about home, enjoying sweet
peace of mind, and the solace of heart-felt thankfulness to the
Shepherd of Israel for the unmerited favour. Attended the
funeral of a deceased neighbour on fourth day and our monthly
meeting on fifth day. The funeral was largely attended by the
neighbouring inhabitants, among whom I was led forth vocally
to espouse the cause of the gospel, in a large impressive testimony.
Many hearts were humbled, and the assembly in general solemnized;
may it be to these as bread cast upon the waters, gathered
after many days.</p>

<p>First day, the 23d. Our meeting to-day was a season thankfully
to be remembered. The subject that arrested my mind
and led to communication, was a comparative view of man with
the rest of the animal creation; showing that man, although
endued with a rational understanding, and blessed with a measure
and manifestation of the spirit of God, to guide him infallibly
in the way of his duty, had nevertheless swerved much further
from the state of rectitude in which he was created, than any other
creature; and was much more changeable and unstable than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[Pg 298]</span>
they. This is a sure mark of his fall: and although continually
liable and willing to change, to gratify his own will and
the humour of others, in following the changeable customs and
manners of a vain world; yet averse to that necessary and laudable
change, whereby he might regain paradise and renew communion
with his Maker. This and much more I was led to
open to the auditory, in the demonstration of the spirit, showing
the way of man’s return; whereby many minds present were
humbled and contrited, and solid satisfaction and comfort afforded
to my own.</p>

<p>On fourth day, I attended a marriage at Bethpage. It was, I
think, a solid instructive season. On fifth day attended our own
meeting which was held in silence. The rest of the week I was
busily attentive to my usual avocations.</p>

<p>First day, the 30th. I attended Westbury meeting, wherein
my mind was opened into a view of man’s primitive state, the
manner and means of his fall, and the way whereby he only can
be restored, all which I had largely to spread before the meeting.
In addition to this, I had also to caution Friends, particularly the
youth, against letting their minds out in their own will and wisdom,
into a search and pursuit after forbidden knowledge, particularly
that of the <i>origin of evil</i>, which in the present day is a
subject of much conversation and inquiry. For man in the
beginning was forbidden the knowledge of good and evil, and that
command is as binding and obligatory in the present day as it
was in the primitive state; therefore all those who presume in
their own wills and creaturely wisdom, independent of the teaching
of the spirit of God, to know good and evil, do thereby desert
God, and so become dead to the divine life; and this is man’s fall,
and leads to Deism and Atheism.</p>

<p>I was much engaged in the course of this week in endeavouring
to arrange and settle some difficulties in the neighbourhood,
and in regulating some of my own temporal affairs. Sat our
meeting on fifth day in silence.</p>

<p>First day, the 6th of 4th month. Sat our meeting to-day in
silence. In the afternoon at the fourth hour, we had a meeting
appointed by a Friend from abroad, who was accompanied by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[Pg 299]</span>
another Friend in the ministry, both of whom appeared in public
testimony.</p>

<p>Most of this week I was occupied about home. Attended our
preparative meeting on fifth day, which being the time of answering
our queries to go forward to the yearly meeting, I was
led to make several remarks to Friends to stir them up to more
faithfulness, in order that we might profit by the queries, and
be prepared to answer them with more clearness and propriety,
according to truth and justice.</p>

<p>First day, the 13th. Sat our meeting to-day in silence. This
week our monthly meeting was held, at which the state of society
as represented by the answers to the queries from our preparative
meetings was attended to, and a summary thereof forwarded to
the quarterly meeting to be held the following week. This order
of reading and answering the queries quarterly, if rightly attended
to, and Friends were generally kept lively in spirit, and were
zealously engaged for the promotion of truth, would, I believe, be
productive of much good to the society: but alas! there are so
many who seem lulled asleep in the lap of the world, and their
minds clothed with so much indifferency, that it is to them but a
dead lifeless form. Surely these reap little or no advantage from
their right of membership among us.</p>

<p>Sixth day. Was our preparative meeting of Ministers and
Elders, in which nothing transpired worthy of notice.</p>

<p>First day, the 20th. Our meeting to-day, as well as at some
former times, has been rather heavy and dull. In the course of
this week I attended our quarterly meeting, held at this time at
New-York. It was in general rather a low time, although not
without some manifestations of divine favour: therefore we had
no cause for murmuring but rather of rejoicing, in that we were
not cast off and forgotten.</p>

<p>First day, the 27th. Sat our meeting again in silence. My
present allotment is to be mostly at home, generally engaged in
temporal concerns for myself and others. But, I trust, instead
of increasing my love to the world and the things of it, I am fast
weaning from it, and my love continually increasing and strengthening
to higher and better objects; as my attention to the world<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[Pg 300]</span>
and its cares arises from necessity and duty, and not from love,
except that I love to do my duty in all respects to God my Creator,
and man my fellow creature, believing that there is no real
Christianity without it.</p>

<p>Our fifth day meeting was quiet and solemn, wherein I had to
remind Friends that it was not enough to say with Peter, when
queried of by his Master whether he loved him, “yea Lord,” for
this is no more than every professor is ready to say, although
they may be quite void of any true sense thereof; but we must
come to know him and love him in such manner, as when
brought to a full trial of our faith and love, we can say as Peter
did in his third answer: “Lord thou knowest all things, thou
knowest that I love thee.” For this is the situation of mind
which prepares to be at his disposal, and to endure hardness for
his sake in the Christian warfare.</p>

<p>First day, the 4th of 5th month. My mind was led into an
interesting view and reflection on the following gracious invitation
of our Lord: “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are
heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon
you, and learn of me: for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye
shall find rest unto your souls.” As the subject spread on my
mind attended with a degree of life, I was constrained to communicate
the prospect, showing that Christ’s yoke was nothing
less nor more than the revealed will of his, and our, heavenly
Father; which, as it is faithfully submitted to, yokes down and
keeps in subjection every desire and propensity of the human
mind which stands in opposition thereto. So that the creature
hereby knows God’s kingdom to be come, and his will to be done,
in earth as it is done in heaven; and the reward of rest and
peace promised in the closing part of the invitation is experienced.</p>

<p>The following part of this week spent principally in my usual
vocations, except attending our preparative meeting on fifth day;
and at the third hour in the afternoon, the funeral of our Friend
Joshua Powell of Westbury, who was taken from us after a short
illness, by a sudden inflammation and mortification in one of his
arms. How true is that saying of the prophet: “All flesh is
grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[Pg 301]</span>
the grass withereth, the flower fadeth;” just such is man, alive
to-day, <span class="correction" title="In the original book: to morrow">to-morrow</span> is dead. This subject very sensibly impressed
my mind at the funeral, and led to an awakening communication,
which had a very reaching effect on the assembly. I hope the
word that went forth will not return void, but prove a blessing to
some who were present.</p>

<p>First day, the 11th. Our meeting to-day was a trying season,
but little felt of the real virtue and life of religion. It seemed
as though we were in a worse condition than the multitude formerly;
for there was a lad found among them with five barley
loaves and a few fishes, which served for the blessing to operate
upon and enlarge, so as to suffice the multitude and leave fragments
remaining; but we were almost, or altogether destitute of
any thing for the blessing of heaven to act upon. Therefore we
ought not to murmur, although we were sent empty away.</p>

<p>Except attending our monthly meeting on fifth day, and
assisting some of my neighbours to settle their business in which
a dispute had arisen, I was principally occupied in my temporal
concerns through the week.</p>

<p>First day, the 18th. A silent meeting to-day. The rest of
this week busily employed preparatory to leaving home to attend
our <span class="correction" title="In the original book: aproaching">approaching</span> yearly meeting. Left home early on seventh
day morning, and got into the city seasonably to attend the
opening of the yearly meeting of Ministers and Elders at the
tenth hour. On second day at the same hour, the meeting for
discipline opened, and continued by adjournments until the seventh
day following. In the forenoon of that day at about eleven
o’clock it closed, under a comfortable evidence that the divine
presence presided; and which, with thankfulness and gratitude we
have humbly to acknowledge, has, in gracious condescension,
been vouchsafed to us in the several sittings of our large solemn
assembly, in as great, if not greater degree, than has been witnessed
in any previous season: tending to unite all the rightly
concerned members in a living travail, for the promotion of the
cause of truth and righteousness, and the spreading and exaltation
of those precious testimonies given us as a people to bear for
the Prince of Peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[Pg 302]</span></p>

<p>First day, the 1st of 6th month. Attended our own meeting
to-day in humbling silence. Spent the week at and about
home, except attending the funeral of our ancient Friend Isaac
Underhill of Flushing, on sixth day; on which occasion a
meeting was held in Friends’ meeting-house at that place. It
was a very solemn, and, I trust, a profitable season to some
present. My mouth was opened among them to testify of the
things concerning the kingdom of God, in a large affecting testimony,
whereby many hearts were contrited and made humbly
thankful for the present favour, and I was glad in believing that
the Lord is still mindful of his people, and is graciously disposed
to strengthen and support them in the needful time; as their eye
is kept single to him, looking to him only for help and salvation.</p>

<p>First day, the 8th. Had a comfortable meeting to-day. The
testimony to the power of truth went forth freely to the people,
comforting and contriting many minds present. This is the
Lord’s doing and is worthy of grateful acknowledgments from his
people, for such continued yet unmerited mercy.</p>

<p>On third day I attended a meeting at Bethpage, appointed by
our friends Elizabeth Coggeshall and Ann Shipley of New-York,
who were now among us on a religious visit. It was, I think, a
season of great favour; not only the two women appeared in
seasonable and appropriate testimonies, tending to gather the
minds of the people into a very comfortable solemnity, but also,
my heart and mouth were opened in a large affecting testimony,
which found a ready entrance into the minds of most present,
breaking down all opposition and contriting many hearts by the
prevalence of truth, which ran as oil over all. After this, our
friend Elizabeth closed the service in solemn supplication. It was
a day of favour, worthy of grateful remembrance.</p>

<p>On fifth day I attended our preparative meeting, in which I
had some service for the promotion of truth’s cause. The four
other days of this week, I spent in my usual necessary avocations.</p>

<p>First day, the 15th. Nothing in particular to remark respecting
the exercise of this day.</p>

<p>On the fourth day of this week, our monthly meeting was held,
in which I was led into some close searching exercise, in order<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[Pg 303]</span>
to stir up Friends to more diligence and circumspection, that so
their light might shine forth to the help of others, and their conduct
appear consonant with their profession. In this meeting I
found it expedient and consistent with my duty, to open to Friends
a prospect and concern which had for a considerable time rested
on my mind, to pay a visit in gospel love, to Friends and others
in some parts of the yearly meetings of Philadelphia and Baltimore.
The subject obtained the solid attention of the meeting,
and some Friends were appointed to confer with me on the subject,
and, as way opened, prepare an essay of a certificate for that
purpose, and produce it to our next meeting.</p>

<p>First day, the 22d. Whilst sitting in our meeting to-day, my
mind was led into a view of the great and singular advantages
that would accrue to the children of men, from their having right
and just ideas of religion, the want of which was the principal
cause of all the distress and misery that fell to their lot, both here
and hereafter. The subject spread, and, as I communicated,
opened to a large field of doctrine, which had a very reaching
effect upon the assembly, and a very precious solemnity was
spread over the meeting; for which my heart was made truly
glad, with that gladness that hath no sorrow with it.</p>

<p>The rest of the week I was busily employed in the care of my
temporal concerns, which nevertheless has no tendency, if kept
within right bounds, to prevent internal religious exercises, and
spiritual meditations and soliloquies. Sat our fifth day meeting in
silence.</p>

<p>First day, the 29th. I sat our meeting to-day in a sense of
great weakness, in which I realized the truth of David’s testimony:
“Verily every man at his best estate is altogether
vanity.”</p>

<p>Except attending in silent meditation our fifth day meeting,
and the funeral of the only daughter of my brother Samuel, on
seventh day, I was engaged as usual during the week, in my
family cares; which indeed is an arduous task, if rightly performed,
and every department duly cared for in its right season,
consistent with our moral and religious duty. The funeral mentioned
above was a solemn one, in which I was largely led forth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[Pg 304]</span>
to testify of the things concerning the kingdom of God; opening
the way of life and salvation to the people, in the demonstration
of the spirit. The assembly were generally solemnized by the
efficacy of the power which attended, and truth raised into victory
over all. Such favours are truly worthy of deep heart-felt gratitude
and thanksgiving to the God and Father of all our sure
mercies, who is over all, worthy for ever.</p>

<p>First day, the 6th of 7th month. Soon after I took my
seat in our meeting to-day, my mind was opened into a view of
the great need man stands in of a Saviour, and that nothing can
give him so full and lively a sense thereof, as a true sight and
sense of his own real condition; by which he is not only brought
to see the real want of a Saviour, but is also shown thereby, what
kind of a Saviour he needs. For it must not only be one, who
is continually present, but who is possessed of a prescience sufficient
to see, at all times, all man’s enemies, and every temptation
that may or can await him; and have power sufficient to defend
him from all, and at all times. Therefore, such a Saviour as
man wants, cannot be one without him, but must be one that is
always present, just in the very place man’s enemies assault him,
which is <i>within</i>, in the very temple of the heart: as no other
Saviour but such an one, who takes his residence in the very
centre of the soul of man, can possibly produce salvation to him:
hence, for man to look for a Saviour or salvation any where
else, than in the very centre of his own soul, is a fatal mistake,
and must consequently land him in disappointment and errour.</p>

<p>I was led forth to communicate largely to the people on the
subject; and on the blessed effects that do, and will result to all
those who find such a Saviour, and who, in humility and sincerity
of heart, follow him faithfully in the way of his leadings.
It was a solemn season, and a day thankfully to be remembered.</p>

<p>I was taken up principally the rest of this week, except attending
our preparative meeting on fifth day, in my hay harvest. It
is a laborious season; and is made much more so by reason of
there being so few faithful labourers, among those who offer
themselves as such. Most of them are more anxiously careful
how they may obtain the highest wages, than to be engaged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[Pg 305]</span>
honestly to strive justly to earn them. This makes the care and
oversight of such business rather irksome and unpleasant, which
otherwise would be agreeable and often delightful.</p>

<p>First day, the 13th. I sat our meeting in silence. This week
I was mostly taken up in caring for and assisting in, my hay
harvest. For by the fertility of the season, our fields have
brought forth plenteously. On fifth day our monthly meeting
was held, in which Friends united with the concern I had laid
before them at the preceding monthly meeting, to pay a visit in
gospel love to Friends and others, in some parts of the yearly
meetings of Philadelphia and Baltimore. A certificate was prepared
for the purpose, leaving me at liberty to proceed therein, as
way should open.</p>

<p>First day, the 20th. A solemn, and, I trust, a profitable meeting
to-day, in which the gospel was preached freely in the demonstration
of truth, and a precious covering was felt to spread over
the assembly; and sweet peace clothed my mind at the conclusion.
Surely the Lord is a bountiful and rich rewarder of all his
faithful servants, who serve him, not for reward, but for the sake
of that love wherewith he loveth them, and which he so abundantly
sheddeth abroad in their hearts, that they are thereby
drawn to love him above all; and in and under the influence of
this precious love, they are led and constrained to serve and worship
him freely for his own sake, because he is worthy, and not
for any reward to themselves, because they are altogether unworthy;
and because that precious love wherewith he hath loved
them, and with which he hath filled their hearts, hath banished
and dispelled therefrom every germ of self-love, and all kind of
selfishness. Nevertheless, of his own rich bounty and free will,
without any real merit on our part, he abundantly and plenteously
bestoweth his blessings upon all his faithful servants and children,
whereby their love to him is continually increased, until he
becomes their all in all, their alpha and omega, and they are
brought into the possession of that perfect love that casteth out
all fear; and in which they are enabled continually to worship
and adore Him who liveth for ever, and who only is everlastingly
worthy of all blessing and praise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[Pg 306]</span></p>

<p>In the course of this week was our quarterly meeting, which
was held at this time at Westbury. It was a season of exercise
to all who were concerned for the promotion of right order in the
Church; and much counsel, reproof, and admonition, were communicated,
under right influence, to stir up the negligent and
refractory members to more faithfulness and attention to their
several duties, and a more full submission to the manifestations
of divine grace in their own minds, that they may be thereby
strengthened to arise, and shake themselves from the dust of the
earth, and separate themselves from those hindering and annoying
things, which divert and turn them aside from their Christian
duty, and those things in which their best interest consists.
The meeting for worship was likewise a favoured season. Many
very important truths of the gospel were clearly opened in the
demonstration of the spirit; and the meeting closed under a
thankful sense of the unmerited mercy; and the living among
us separated to their several homes with grateful hearts.</p>

<p>I laid before this meeting my prospect of a religious visit as
aforementioned, and received the unity and concurrence of the
men’s and women’s meetings; and an endorsement thereof was
made on my certificate. Being now left at liberty, and separated
to the work whereunto I believed myself called by the Holy
Spirit, and knowing my own insufficiency, and that of myself I
can do nothing, all that remains for me is to cast my care
wholly on him, in full faith, who hath called me; and, as I abide
in the patience and in a full submission to his heavenly will, he
that putteth his servants forth, will in his own right time go
before them and make way for them, without which there is no
way; and will make darkness light before them, and not forsake,
but safely carry them through and over all the opposition and
discouragements, that either men or devils may or can cast in the
way, to the exceeding praise of his grace, and to the glory and
exaltation of his great and excellent name, who is over all, God
blessed for ever.</p>

<p>First day, the 27th. My mind while sitting in our meeting
to-day, was led into a view of the great necessity there was of
more <span class="correction" title="In the original book: faithfulnes">faithfulness</span> and attention to the inward principle of divine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[Pg 307]</span>
truth, or inward teacher in the mind, as professed by us as a people.
For want of this, many were led into divers errours and deficiencies,
which in their tendency not only led to great weakness,
but to the encouragement of evil doers in their evil practices; a
sight and sense of which had for some time been a cause of much
exercise to my mind. The subject became very impressive,
insomuch that I found it necessary to spread it before the meeting
in a large arousing testimony; laying before the auditory the
great danger many were in for want of a living concern to work
out, through the assistance of divine grace, their salvation while
the day of visitation was lengthened out. For nothing short
of a full submission to the operation of divine truth on their
minds could fit and prepare them for the awful approaching season,
when the pale-faced messenger shall arraign us before the
judgment seat of Him, whom we can neither awe nor bribe, to
give an account of the deeds done in the body, whether good or
evil. A solemn weight spread over the meeting and many minds
appeared to be deeply humbled. May the exhortation be fixed
in their remembrance, as a nail in a sure place that may not be
moved, is the fervent desire of my mind.</p>

<p>The rest of this week I was busily employed in endeavouring
so to arrange my temporal matters, that when I leave home on
the prospect before me, I may feel my mind at full liberty therefrom,
and that no occasion may be given, through the medium
of any of my temporal engagements, for the enemies of truth to
gainsay or find fault, to the disadvantage or reproach of the great
and dignified cause I was about to embark in. For I have been
led to believe some who have gone out on this solemn embassy,
for want of this care have given too much occasion for censure,
and have thereby wounded the cause they have proposed to
promote, and brought much exercise on the minds of the
faithful.</p>

<p>On fifth day at our meeting, my mind was deeply bowed in
commemoration of the Lord’s continued mercies, and that indeed
it might be said of us as it was of Israel formerly, that it was of
the Lord’s mercies we were not consumed; and I was made
thankful in believing, that there was a small remnant who were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[Pg 308]</span>
preserved faithful to his name and cause, and who were the salt
of the society, and for whose sake he would not utterly cast us
off nor forsake us. Surely it is of his unmerited mercy that we
are not swallowed up in the mass of the people, and numbered
among the unstable multitude who have no sure and solid
foundation to rest their hopes upon, but are trusting in a ceremonial
religion, of man’s invention; all which in the day of trial
will fail them, and afford no succour to the soul.</p>

<p>First day, the 3d of 8th month. My mind was brought under
exercise in our meeting to-day, in a view of the great want of
diligent attention to the light within, or that measure of the spirit
given to every one of God’s rational creatures to profit withal;
even those who were so far convinced as to acknowledge its
excellence, yet were almost daily neglecting its reproofs, and turning
aside from its teachings; by which their understandings became
darkened, and they were left in a dwarfish unstable condition,
without any solid ground of hope. The subject spread,
and my mind was led into a large arousing testimony, setting
forth the danger of such a state, and the fatal consequences that
would naturally and certainly follow such delinquency if continued
in. Truth prevailed, and many minds were sensibly
bowed and affected by its power, and a very general solemnity
spread over the meeting, to the praise of Him who is calling all
his faithful and obedient children out of darkness into his marvellous
light. The rest of the week spent as usual without
occasion for any remark.</p>

<p>First day, the 10th. A peaceful quiet meeting to-day in silent
waiting. The rest of the week, except attending our meeting
for sufferings and preparative meeting on fifth day, was taken up
in my outward business; with a steady view to my religious
engagement, that with all readiness I might be prepared to embark
therein when the full time arrived.</p>

<p>First day, the 17th. A silent meeting. This week was taken
up preparatory to my journey. Attended our monthly meeting
on fifth day, and feeling my mind drawn towards an opportunity
with the people of colour before I left home, I mentioned it to
the meeting; and with the unity of Friends, a meeting was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[Pg 309]</span>
appointed for them on the following first day at the fourth hour in
the afternoon. I also gave Friends of Bethpage meeting information,
that I felt my mind drawn to sit with them in their
meeting the next first day, and left them at liberty to inform their
neighbours thereof.</p>

<p>First day, the 24th. Agreeably to my prospect I attended
Bethpage meeting in the forenoon. It was large, and I think,
greatly favoured with the overshadowing wing of divine kindness.
Truth rose into dominion, and bowed the assembly by
the prevalence of its power, for which my spirit was made deeply
thankful.</p>

<p>The meeting for the coloured people was held at the fourth hour,
and I was enabled to clear my mind among them, although it
was a season of hard labour. After this I felt my mind clear to
set forward on my intended journey.</p>

<p>Fourth day, the 27th of 8th month. I left home in the afternoon
in order to accomplish my contemplated visit to Friends and
others, in some parts of the yearly meetings of Philadelphia and
Baltimore. My son-in-law Valentine Hicks, accompanied me in
the journey. Feeling my mind drawn to attend the meeting of
Friends at Flushing the next day, we rode there and lodged.
Notice being given in the neighbourhood of my intention to be
there, the meeting was large, and the Lord graciously manifested
himself to be near, and enabled me to discharge myself
faithfully among them under the feeling influence of gospel love.
Many hearts were contrited and truth appeared in dominion over
all, for which favour I was made reverently thankful, not only on
my own account and the account of those present, but especially
so on account of my dear family and friends at home, who gave
me up with great reluctance on account of my present bodily
indisposition, being under the pressure of a heavy cold and very
hard cough, which, in their apprehensions, rendered me unable
to travel in so arduous a service until I might be recovered therefrom.
But the time appearing to be come for my setting out, and
the way appearing open, I considered it safest to cast my care
wholly upon Him in faith, who, I believed, had called me to the
work; and that as I continued to go forward, as he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[Pg 310]</span>
graciously pleased to open the way and make it clear before me,
all would be well, whether it terminated in life or in death.</p>

<p>The next day, being the sixth of the week, we had an appointed
meeting in Friends’ meeting-house, at the Kilns, in
Newtown. The meeting there, had been discontinued for a
number of years, and now there was but one member of our
society left in the neighbourhood. There was, however, a considerable
number of people of other persuasions collected; and the
Lord graciously condescended to enable me to preach the gospel
among them, and to open divers doctrines of the Christian religion,
suited to their several conditions, in the demonstration of
truth, for their consideration and instruction. The people were
very solemn and quiet; and, I hope, the labour will not prove in
vain, but be to some of them, as bread cast upon the waters,
gathered after many days. We rode, after this meeting, to New-York,
and rested on seventh day.</p>

<p>First day, the 31st. We attended Pearl-street meeting in the
morning, and that at Liberty-street, in the afternoon. They
were both full meetings; and, although I was still under considerable
bodily indisposition, yet, through condescending goodness,
I was strengthened to discharge myself faithfully in both opportunities,
and felt peace in my labours of love among them; being
led in each meeting to declare largely of the things concerning the
kingdom of God, and to point out to the people, in a clear manner,
the way to peace and salvation.</p>

<p>On second day afternoon, we proceeded on our journey to
Newark, a town in New Jersey, where we attended a meeting at
the fourth hour, previous notice having been given in the town,
of our coming. I had had several meetings there before; but
this was larger than usual for the place. There is no member of
our society residing in the town; the inhabitants being principally
of the Presbyterian order. All was quiet, and a general solemnity
spread over the meeting; and truth and its testimony were
raised into dominion. Surely, it is the Lord’s doing, and my spirit
was made gratefully thankful for the unmerited favour.</p>

<p>The next day we attended a meeting appointed for us in Elizabethtown.
Here, likewise, there is no member of our society.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[Pg 311]</span>
The meeting was small, yet through condescending goodness it
proved, I trust, a comfortable instructive season to some present;
and I parted with them in peace of mind, the sure reward of faithfulness.</p>

<p>From this place, we rode home with our kind friend Henry
Shotwell, of Rahway, who met us here. The next day we
attended <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Friend’s">Friends’</span> meeting at Plainfield. Notice having been
given that we intended to be there, the meeting was large, in
which the Lord’s power was manifested, and his arm made bare
for our help; and through which, way was made and utterance
given, to preach the glad tidings of life and salvation to the people,
in the demonstration of the spirit. Many hearts were broken
and contrited by the prevalence of its power. May the glory and
the praise be all ascribed to our gracious Helper, for such continued
mercy; for he only is worthy thereof, as nothing is due
to the creature, but blushing and confusion of face.</p>

<p>After this favoured meeting, we rode back, towards evening, to
Rahway. The next day, being the fifth of the week, we attended
Friends’ meeting there. The meeting was much enlarged by
many of the neighbouring inhabitants coming in, who were not
members. Many gospel truths were opened to their consideration,
and its power ran as oil over the assembly, silencing all opposition,
and a perfect calm was witnessed to spread over all. I have not
often beheld such a perfect quiet; such seasons are truly encouraging,
and worthy of thanksgiving and praise to the blessed
Author of such unmerited favours.</p>

<p>On sixth day morning, we took leave of our kind friends at Rahway,
and rode to Mendham, alias, Randolph. The next day we
had an appointed meeting there, at the tenth hour, which proved
a solemn, instructive season. I left them with peace of mind, and
proceeded that afternoon to Hardwick. The following day being
the first of the week, we attended Friends’ meeting there. It was
large for the place, as notice had been given that we expected to
be there. And, through heavenly help, the gospel was preached
in the demonstration of the spirit; and, by the influence of its
power, a general solemnity was spread over the assembly, and
many hearts were broken and contrited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[Pg 312]</span></p>

<p>On second day we proceeded to Stroudsburgh, in Pennsylvania,
where we arrived about three o’clock in the afternoon. Here
we had a meeting, by appointment, the next day, at the third
hour. It was well attended by the Friends of that place, and
many of the neighbouring inhabitants; and was a very solid, instructive
season. Surely, such unmerited favours greatly enhance
our obligations to our all-gracious Benefactor, and tend to inspire
the minds of his humble dependant children with gratitude and
thanksgiving.</p>

<p>From this place we proceeded to Richland, and attended
Friends’ meeting on fifth day. It was much enlarged by many
who were not members coming in. From thence we went to
Plumbstead, where, by previous appointment, we had a meeting
the next day. Both these meetings were seasons of favour.
Surely, it is cause of deep humiliation, when we consider the
many sorrowful deviations which are obvious among us from the
simplicity and purity of our holy profession, and the great want
of faithfulness in the support of those noble testimonies given us
to bear, for the Prince of peace: yet, nevertheless, in the midst of
all our backslidings, the condescending goodness of our heavenly
Father is such, as to break the bread and distil the water of life,
often, on our gathered assemblies; satisfying the hungry and
thirsty soul, and causing his heavenly rain to descend on the
thoughtless and worldly-minded professors, whose hearts are like
the dry and barren ground, in order that they may be softened
and rendered fit for the seed of his heavenly kingdom to take root
in and grow, to the praise of his grace, and the glory of his great
and excellent name.</p>

<p>From Plumbstead we proceeded to Buckingham, and rested on
seventh day, as I was still unwell with a cough, although much
better than when I left home. On first day we attended Friends’
meeting here, which was large, and favoured with the overshadowings
of the heavenly Father’s regard, which caused the
faithful to rejoice. On second day we rested with our ancient and
worthy friend, Oliver Paxton, who was under deep bodily affliction,
and appeared drawing fast towards his close. He was lively
in spirit, and cheerfully and patiently resigned to his heavenly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[Pg 313]</span>
Master’s will. It was comfortable and instructive to be in his
company.</p>

<p>On third day we were at Solebury meeting, of which our
aforesaid friend was a member; and, although in much weakness
and affliction of body, he accompanied us thereto, and a
blessed meeting we had. After this, I parted with him in near
unity of spirit, which was a final parting to us, as to the body:
for he lived but a short time after. He was an elder and judge
in Israel; and his memory will be precious to all the living, who
were acquainted with him, and knew his worth.</p>

<p>The three following days we attended meetings at Wright’s
Town, Makefield, and Newtown. These were all large, favoured
meetings, in which the power of truth was exalted over all
opposition.</p>

<p>On seventh day we rested, and wrote to our families.</p>

<p>On first day, the 21st of 9th month, we attended Horsham
meeting, which was very large. Strength was afforded me to
communicate to the people, and open many gospel truths, to the
relief of my own mind, and, I trust, to the general satisfaction,
comfort and instruction of the assembly, which was composed of
various denominations of professed Christians, besides Friends.</p>

<p>Second and third days. We attended meetings at Upper Dublin
and North Wales. In both of these meetings the heavenly
Father’s power and presence were felt to preside, in an eminent
degree, breaking down and reducing by its blessed influence all
opposing and contrary spirits, and covering the assemblies with
a precious solemnity, especially the latter, in which, truth reigned
triumphantly over all.</p>

<p>On fourth day we had an appointed meeting in a village called
Norristown. It was held in their court-house, there being only
a few scattered members of our society living in the place. The
meeting was pretty large, principally of people of other professions;
among whom was the chief judge, and several lawyers and
priests. All were quiet, and through the condescending goodness
of the Shepherd of Israel, it was, I trust and believe, to most present,
a very instructive and precious season.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[Pg 314]</span></p>

<p>Fifth and sixth days. We were at Friends’ meetings as they
came in course, at Plymouth and Providence. Notice having
been given of our coming, they were much enlarged by the attendance
of the neighbours who were not members. These were
precious opportunities, in which help was afforded to preach the
gospel of life and salvation to the people, accompanied with a
power which broke down and subjected all to its blessed influence;
for which unmerited favour, the hearts of the faithful were
made to rejoice, and in deep humiliation, to return thanksgiving
and praise to the benevolent and gracious Author of all our
blessings.</p>

<p>On seventh day we rested at Charlestown. On first day
attended the meeting at that place, which was large, many more
attending than the house could contain. The three following
days we attended meetings at the Valley, Pikeland, and Nantmill.
These were all precious meetings, in which the Lord’s presence
and power were manifested for our help.</p>

<p>On fifth day we proceeded to Columbia, a town situated on the
east side of the river Susquehannah. We had an appointed
meeting there the next day, in which truth prevailed; nevertheless,
a hireling priest who attended the meeting, afterwards made
some objection to the doctrine delivered, as it counteracted his
traditional belief concerning the atonement, the carnal ordinances
of water baptism, and the outward bread and wine, and preaching
for hire, and the scriptures being the only rule of faith and practice;
the fallacy and inutility of all which had been laid open and
exposed. This roused his opposition; and indeed, it is not to be
wondered at, as it goes to overthrow all their craft, by which they
have their wealth.</p>

<p>We proceeded from thence to Little York, and rested on seventh
day. On first day, attended Friends’ meeting there. It was a
pretty large, favoured meeting, but not feeling my mind fully clear,
I proposed another meeting in the evening; and, notice being
given accordingly, it was very large, more than the house could
contain. It was a blessed meeting, in which the Lord’s presence
and power were manifested, and truth raised into dominion
over all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[Pg 315]</span></p>

<p>The four following days, we had meetings at Newbury, Warrington,
Huntington and <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Monallin">Menallen</span>. In these opportunities my
mind was much engaged to turn the attention of the people from
man, and from all dependance on any thing without them, to the
inward principle of divine light and truth, the great gospel minister;
which, as it is heeded and obeyed, leadeth into all truth, and
out of all errour; and without whose teaching, the true and
saving knowledge of God and Christ, which only brings eternal
life to the soul, can never be obtained, although we may be
favoured to sit under the most powerful gospel ministry, through
the instrumentality of man, however divinely qualified to that end,
from youth to old age. For all that the best outward instrumental
help, either from reading the scriptures, or hearing the
gospel preached in the clear demonstration of the spirit, can do for
any man, is only to point to, and lead the minds of the children
of men home to this divine inward principle, manifested in their
own hearts and minds.</p>

<p>These were all favoured, instructive seasons, worthy of grateful
remembrance.</p>

<p>From Menallen we rode to Baltimore, in order to attend the
yearly meeting at that place, where we arrived on sixth day evening,
the 10th of 10th month. The yearly meeting of Ministers
and Elders opened the next day at the tenth hour, and the yearly
meeting for discipline at the tenth hour, on the following second
day; and continued by adjournments until the next sixth day at
evening, when the meeting closed under an evident sense of divine
favour, and which had been graciously extended through the
several sittings of the meeting. I had much general and particular
service in the course of the meetings, both in those for
worship, and those for discipline; tending to gather Friends’
minds, to an inward, faithful exercise for the support and promotion
of those noble testimonies, that we, as a people, are called to
bear for the Prince of Peace; and for the exaltation of truth and
righteousness in the earth. The Lord our gracious helper, by
his presence and power, manifested himself to be near, setting
home the doctrines delivered to his witness in the hearts of most
present; whereby Friends appeared generally to be united in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[Pg 316]</span>
spirit, and comforted together under a renewed sense of the Lord’s
goodness; and we parted from each other with thankful hearts.</p>

<p>The meeting being ended, we left the city the next morning,
in order to take a few meetings which lay westerly, or southwesterly
from this place. We were out from the city about two
weeks, and attended the following meetings, viz: Pipe Creek,
Bush Creek, Fairfax, Goose Creek, South Fork, Alexandria,
Washington, Sandy Spring, Indian Spring, and Elk-Ridge. All
favoured meetings, in which the Lord’s power and presence were
manifested for our help, enabling to preach the gospel in the
authority of truth, to the comfort and instruction of the honest
seekers, and rejoicing the hearts of the faithful, and administering
reproof and caution to the disobedient and ungodly, and to such as
are living at ease without God in the world. I felt sweet peace
in my labours of love among them.</p>

<p>After the latter meeting, we returned again to Baltimore on
sixth day afternoon, the 31st of 10th month. Here we continued
until the 11th of 11th month, not only attending Friends’
usual meetings as they came in course in the city, but likewise
their monthly meetings, and quarterly meeting, which were
held during the time. In all of these I was led into much
exercise and religious labour, both in the ministry and in the
discipline and order of the Church. We had, likewise, during
our stay in the city, three very large, satisfactory evening meetings
with the citizens at large. Two were for the white people, and
one for the people of colour. I was led forth among them, and
strengthened largely to declare of the things concerning the
kingdom of God, and to open to their consideration divers important
doctrines of the gospel, in the authority and demonstration
of truth, apparently to their general satisfaction, and to the comfort
and edification of my friends, and the solid peace of my own
mind. I then took leave of them, under the precious uniting
influence of the heavenly Father’s love, and the covering of deep
thankfulness and gratitude for the unmerited favour.</p>

<p>On third day, the 11th of the month, we left the city and proceeded
to a place called the Bush, where there is a small meeting
of Friends. The three following days we attended meetings at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[Pg 317]</span>
that place, at Deer Creek, and East Nottingham, all favoured
seasons. After the latter meeting on seventh day, we proceeded
to Wilmington, and attended Friends’ meetings there the next
day, both forenoon and afternoon, in which truth favoured with
ability to preach the gospel in the demonstration of the spirit,
suited, I trust, to the states of many, or most, of the people which
composed those large assemblies, and I left them with peace of
mind.</p>

<p>On second day I rode to London Grove, accompanied by my
kind friend William Poole of Brandywine, my companion being
disposed to tarry a day longer at Wilmington. On third day the
quarterly meeting opened there with a meeting of Ministers and
Elders; in which I was led to open to Friends of that meeting,
the great obligations and accountability which attached to those
who consented to take seats in such meetings. For it placed us
in the front of society, and consequently we were looked to as the
leaders of the people; and therefore if we should fall short in
faithfully holding up those precious testimonies we are called to
bear for the Prince of Peace, and in leading forward the flock by
advancing the reformation as truth opens the way, we shall
become stumbling blocks in the way of the honest travellers, and
thereby shut up their way to improvement, by which they may
be discouraged and fall back and be lost; in consequence whereof
it is to be feared, their blood might be required at the hands of
such unfaithful and dilatory shepherds. It was an instructive
searching opportunity, in which truth prevailed in an humbling
degree.</p>

<p>The next day was the meeting for discipline. It was also a
very favoured searching season, in which many of the hidden
things of Esau or the first nature were brought to light and
exposed, and the careless worldly-minded professors reproved, and
the honest-hearted comforted and encouraged.</p>

<p>After this, feeling a draft of love to those not in membership
with us, I proposed an opportunity for them the next day; and
Friends uniting therewith, a meeting was accordingly appointed.
It was a large gathering and mercifully owned by the Head of
the Church, by the gracious manifestation of his divine presence;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[Pg 318]</span>
under the blessed influence of which, the gospel was preached in
the demonstration of the spirit, and I parted with them under a
thankful sense of the Lord’s mercy, accompanied with a peaceful
mind, and rode that afternoon to Concord.</p>

<p>On sixth day we rode to Darby and lodged with our kind
friend Edward Garrigues, who accompanied us the next morning
to Philadelphia. Here we continued about a week, attending
Friends’ meetings in the city as they came in course. As information
of our coming had spread in the town the meetings were
greatly thronged, and at some places many more than the houses
could contain; people of varied professions, and some of almost
every description, high and low, appeared eager to attend. It
seemed a renewed visitation to the people in general, Friends and
others; and not only at meetings but in Friends’ families where we
visited, large numbers, especially of the younger classes, would
soon collect; so that those opportunities were made seasons of
instruction and edification. For the Lord, I believe, beheld them
with a gracious eye, and opened my heart and mouth in converse
and communication, to the comfort and satisfaction of their
inquiring minds, and enabled me in each meeting to communicate
in the line of the gospel in large impressive testimonies,
affording instruction, comfort and edification to the assemblies in
general; and I felt a great power of love to flow freely towards
them, which caused my heart to rejoice, and I was made glad
in believing that it was the Lord’s doing, and it was marvellous
in mine eyes.</p>

<p>After I had got through Friends’ meetings, I felt my mind
drawn to have a public opportunity for those not of our society;
and Friends uniting therewith, it was concluded to be held on
the evening of sixth day. Friends apprehending that the numbers
who would be desirous of attending would be very great, it
was appointed at Mulberry-street, their largest house. As the notice
was given at the monthly meeting at that house, Friends likewise
appointed a large committee of men and women to have the
oversight of its gathering, and to keep Friends out until their neighbours
should first have seats: but the number that collected of
other people was so great, that it was supposed as many went away<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[Pg 319]</span>
after the house was filled, and the yard around the house as far
as they could hear, as there was in the house. Every avenue
in the house was filled with people, standing as close as they
could crowd together. Such a collection of people I never saw
together before on any such occasion. It was with great difficulty
that I got into the meeting, and when I had taken my seat,
in viewing the crowded state of the multitude, I was ready to fear
that the pressure of the people upon one another would destroy
the solemnity of the meeting; but as I centered down to the gift,
life and strength sprang up, and faith was increased; and the
Lord made bare his arm for our help, and soon opened my mouth
among them, which brought a precious calm over the assembly.
Indeed I could scarcely have thought it possible had I not seen
it, that such a large promiscuous multitude, made up almost of
every description of people, should in a few moments be brought
into such a perfect state of quiet and remain so for hours, until
the meeting closed; especially as in the midst of the meeting
while I was communicating, some ill advised persons, in order to
disturb the meeting, made a great cry of fire, rattling their engines
along the street near the house, but it had no tendency to break
the solemnity of the meeting. My heart and all that was alive
within me, was bowed in humble thankfulness to the Lord our
gracious helper, for such a marvellous and unmerited favour.
As my whole man was filled with a flow of heavenly love to the
multitude, it was likewise very comfortable to feel a mutual
return from them, for all that could come near me manifested it,
both by conduct and converse; such a time I never witnessed
before: surely it was the Lord’s doing, and to him belongs all
the praise and glory of his own work, nothing due to the creature
but blushing and confusion of face. So let it be. Amen, saith
my spirit.</p>

<p>After having got thus favourably through my service in the
city, the next morning I took an affectionate farewell of my
friends there, in much unity of spirit, and passed over the Delaware
to Newtown, in Jersey: where by previous appointment
I had a meeting at the eleventh hour. A considerable number
of Friends accompanied me thither from the city. Here we had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[Pg 320]</span>
another precious instructive meeting. The next day being the
first of the week, we attended Friends’ meeting at Woodbury;
and notice being spread of our intention of being there it was
unusually large; and through the condescending goodness of Him
who opens and none can shut, my heart and mouth were opened
in a large effective testimony, in which was opened to the people
divers of the most essential doctrines of Christianity, I trust, to
the general instruction and edification of those present, and to the
comfort and peace of my own mind.</p>

<p>The seven following days we attended meetings at <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Mulica">Mullica</span>
Hill, Upper Greenwich, Penn’s Neck, Piles Grove, Salem, Alloway’s
Creek, and Lower Greenwich. These were all large
favoured meetings, particularly the one at Salem; at which place
the county court was then sitting, which was adjourned by the
judge in order to give the people generally an opportunity to
attend the meeting, which they did; the judge and lawyers with
the rest of the court also attended. The gospel was preached to
them and the doctrines of Christianity largely opened, apparently
to the satisfaction of all; and truth was raised into dominion over
all that was contrary to its blessed influence.</p>

<p>From the latter place we proceeded on second day, the 8th of
12th month, to Morris River, alias Port Elizabeth, where we had
a very instructive edifying meeting the next day. The day
following we rode to Little Eggharbour; and the next day being
the fifth of the week, we attended Friends’ monthly meeting
there. The meeting for worship was favoured, and truth prevailed
by way of testimony; and many gospel truths were opened
to the consideration of the people, whereby many hearts were
humbled and contrited.</p>

<p>The meeting for discipline was very weakly conducted. The
order of truth being at a low ebb with Friends of this place, and
but little hope of improvement, unless the younger classes in
society come forward in more faithfulness than their elder brethren
have done. For most of the few that are left appeared to
be settling on their lees, without any thought or prospect of
advancing the noble testimonies we are called to bear.</p>

<p>Our next meeting was at Barnegat: the day being rainy it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[Pg 321]</span>
was small, yet a precious favoured season. The next day being
the seventh of the week we rode to Squan, and the two following
days attended the meeting at that place and at Squancum; but
the weather being still rainy, these were also small meetings:
but the power of truth being present for our help, rendered the
opportunities instructive and edifying. After the latter meeting
we proceeded to Shrewsbury, and on third day, the 16th of 12th
month, we had an appointed meeting there which was large and
satisfactory. Many gospel truths were fully and clearly opened
to the apparent satisfaction, and, I trust, to the instruction and
edification of the assembly in general. It was a very solemn
meeting, in which truth was raised into dominion, humbling
and contriting many hearts; and which brought my religious
labours in this journey to a peaceful close.</p>

<p>After this, the three following days I passed directly home, and
found my dear wife, children, and grand-children in usual health,
to our mutual rejoicing. For this favour, together with the continued
evidence of the divine favour which had accompanied me
in this journey, strengthening and enabling me from day to day,
faithfully to perform the work and service the Lord had appointed
me, my mind was impressed with deep thankfulness and gratitude
for the unmerited mercy.</p>

<p>Praise the Lord, O my soul! and forget not any of his benefits,
for he hath dealt bountifully with thee, and set thee above all
thine enemies, to the exaltation of his own glorious name and
power; and who is God over all, blessed for ever.</p>

<p class="chap-head">Engagements at and near home, and within the limits of Westbury quarterly
meeting&mdash;Visit to some parts of the yearly meeting of New-York, 1818.</p>


<p>First day, the 21st of 12th month, 1817. I again met with
my friends at home, in our own meeting, and was glad to see
them; having been absent nearly four months, in which time I
travelled about eleven hundred miles, and attended eighty-five
meetings for worship, and eleven for discipline. And now, at
home, I find no time to be idle; for in this first meeting, my mind
was brought under exercise, and I had to tell my friends, that if
we would be Christians, we must be united to Christ, and learn
by his example to do good for evil; as it is no certain mark of a
real Christian, to be in the practice of mutual returns of good
offices to one another. For sinners give and lend to sinners, to
receive as much again. I found afterwards that there was just
occasion for my exercise, as some of my neighbours, members of
society, had been disputing and differing about trivial matters of
property. Alas for such! what peace can they have on earth,
and much less can they hope for any in heaven, when done with
time. For such dispositions cannot possibly be happy in the presence
of a just, holy, and merciful Being, who is love ineffable.</p>

<p>I sat our meeting on fifth day in silence, and nothing unusual
occurred the rest of the week.</p>

<p>First day, the 28th. I was led, while sitting in our meeting
to-day, into a view of the great want generally manifested by the
people, of living in the fear of the Lord, and of seeking to be initiated
into his kingdom of peace and love; as nothing short of it
can administer to any the joys of salvation, or produce a real
redemption from the power of evil. The subject spread on my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[Pg 323]</span>
mind, and opened to a pretty full communication, in the line of
close caution and warning to the indolent and unconcerned, respecting
the necessary preparation for our final change. A solemn
weight spread over the assembly, and I have a hope the labour
will not be all lost, but sink deep and remain on some minds.</p>

<p>In the course of this week my case seemed to resemble Mordecai’s
of old; after riding the king’s horse, he had to retire to the
king’s gate, and there wait for fresh direction. I also felt my
mind brought into a waiting quiet state, in poverty of spirit.
Attended our fifth day meeting mostly in silence, except just
before the close I had to remark to Friends the great advantage
that accrued to us by being embodied together in religious
society, under the influence of truth, as our duties and religious
obligations became more binding upon us, especially the diligent
attendance of meetings for worship, which gave us frequent
opportunity of inquiring into our own states, and how far we
stood accepted in the divine sight, and were at peace with Him
and with all men; for this is a very requisite care which ought
not to be neglected, but always be first in our minds.</p>

<p>First day, the 4th of 1st month, 1818. Having felt my mind
for several days drawn to sit with my friends at Martinicock, I
accordingly went on this day, accompanied by my wife and
daughter Elizabeth. Although the meeting was not altogether
so large as at some other times on this day of the week, the
weather being cold, yet the opportunity, through the manifestation
of divine regard, by which I was enabled to preach the gospel
in the demonstration of truth, was rendered an instructive
edifying season, and we were comforted together under a renewed
sense of the Lord’s goodness.</p>

<p>Second day. I attended the funeral of a neighbour. It was
a promiscuous gathering of different societies of professed Christians.
I was largely led forth among them to declare of the
things concerning the kingdom of God, and to open to the people
in a clear and impressive manner, the way and means by which
we may come to have an inheritance therein, and that nothing
short of our coming into a passive state without a will of our own,
as a little child, agreeably to the doctrine of our Lord, will ever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[Pg 324]</span>
qualify us for that blessed inheritance, where nothing that worketh
an abomination or maketh a lie can ever enter. It was a season
of favour, in which truth had the victory, and I felt peace in
my labour of love among them.</p>

<p>On third day I went to New-York, accompanied by my son-in-law
Valentine Hicks, in order to attend the monthly meeting of
Friends there, which came the next day. I attended it accordingly.
It was a pretty full meeting, in which I was led in a
close, searching line in my testimony, which agitated some of the
worshippers in the outer court, and made them fretful. Alas for
such professors! what will they do in the end, when the winds
blow and the rains descend? Surely their sandy foundation will
fail them; then will they be made to call to the rocks and mountains
of their own exalted self-righteousness, to cover them from
the prevailing indignation which they have brought upon themselves,
by their own neglect of a right improvement of the talent
with which they had been entrusted, and which they had buried
in an earthly mind; but their cries will be in vain, as the hypocrite’s
hope will perish.</p>

<p>Fifth day. I attended Friends’ meeting held in the middle of
the week at Flushing, at which there was a marriage, which caused
it to be much enlarged, by many of the neighbouring inhabitants
coming in who do not usually attend. It was a favoured season,
in which I was led to communicate divers important doctrines of
the Christian religion, and to open the true ground of the marriage
covenant, whereby male and female may be rightly joined
together, so as to become true helpers and blessings to each other.
After this, I returned home that evening with the blessing of
peace, the sure reward of faithfulness, and retired willingly to the
waiting gate of inward trust, and poverty of spirit.</p>

<p>First day, the 11th. My mind was led into a view of the
necessity of doing all our works to please God, and not to please
ourselves, or one another; and the only way to please our neighbours
to edification, was to do all to please the Lord, who hath
promised that if our ways please him he will make our enemies
to be at peace with us. The subject spread and led to communication,
in which the people were invited to acquaint themselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[Pg 325]</span>
with God, and be at peace with him by doing his will, and not
our own, whereby good would come unto us; hence we should
please one another to our mutual edification and comfort.</p>

<p>On fifth day our monthly meeting was held. It was a season
of exercise, occasioned by a case of difficulty being improperly
introduced into the meeting.</p>

<p>I saw clearly the meeting could not get along with it in its
present form, as it had taken ground which was not tenable.
It was therefore agreed to dismiss the subject for the present, and
let it be taken up anew, unless on a further investigation by the
overseers, it should be settled.</p>

<p>How necessary it is for those who take an active part in the
discipline of the Church, to wait for a right qualification, and not
to put a hand to the work until they are rightly called and
furnished, with that wisdom which is profitable to direct; for otherwise,
instead of advancing the cause of righteousness, they may
retard its progress, and do harm to themselves, like Uzza of old,
when he put forth an unsanctified hand to steady the ark.</p>

<p>I opened in this meeting to my friends, a prospect I had of
paying a religious visit to some of the neighbouring inhabitants
not in membership with us, within the borders of our quarterly
meeting; with which the meeting united, and left me at liberty
to pursue the prospect as way might open for it.</p>

<p>The rest of this week was spent in the care of my necessary
temporal concerns, and the week ended with peace of mind
and a thankful heart, for the continued blessings of a gracious
Providence.</p>

<p>First day, the 18th. Our meeting to-day was favoured, and
the power of truth exalted, and the gospel preached in its own
authority, and a precious solemnity spread over the meeting, which
ended in thanksgiving for the mercy, and solemn supplication for
the continuance of divine regard.</p>

<p>In the course of this week our quarterly meeting was held at
Westbury. It was a favoured season, particularly the last day or
closing meeting for public worship, in which the Lord’s presence
and power were manifested in an eminent degree, and truth was
exalted and a precious solemnity spread over the assembly, con<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[Pg 326]</span>victing,
contriting, and comforting many hearts; to the praise
of Him who is calling us out of darkness into his marvellous
light.</p>

<p>First day, the 25th. A silent meeting on my part to-day.
How comfortable it is to sit silently under the shadow of our own
vine and our own fig-tree, where none can make afraid.</p>

<p>Second day. I attended the funeral of my eldest and last
surviving brother. I am now the last and only survivor of six
brethren, and am myself arrived nearly to the age of three score
and ten; therefore cannot expect many more days, as I continually
feel time making its ravages on the animal system, and
which, as a faithful herald, exclaims repeatedly to the inward
ear, “prepare to die.” There was a large promiscuous collection of
people of different societies attended the funeral. I was largely led
forth among them to declare the way of life and salvation, and to
open many very important doctrines of the Christian religion. The
assembly were generally very quiet and attentive, and, I believe,
to many, it was a season of solid instruction and edification.
I left them with peace of mind and a thankful heart.</p>

<p>I attended our fifth day meeting as usual, and mostly in silence.
On sixth day I attended the funeral of a person not in membership.
It was principally made up of the poorer kind of people,
who made little or no profession of religion, except a few Friends
and some of the Methodist society. I was deeply baptized into
a feeling of their weak state, in which I was led to communicate
according to their capacity to receive; which brought a comfortable
solemnity over the assembly to their general satisfaction, and
I felt peace in my labour of love among them.</p>

<p>First day, the 1st of 2d month. As I sat musing in silence in
our meeting, my mind was led into a view of the great mischief
and harm which result to mankind, by their giving way to harbour
and indulge vain and evil thoughts. The subject spread and led
to communication, in which I had to show to the assembly that
our redemption and salvation principally depended on a right
government of our thoughts, and that if men and women were
as fearful of evil thinking as they are of evil doing, and as desirous
of avoiding one as the other, they would soon find themselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[Pg 327]</span>
empowered as fully to avoid evil thinking as to avoid evil doing;
and this would be a suppression of sin in its first rise: and there
is no other way for any man or woman to become righteous and
holy in the sight of God, who as certainly at all times sees our
evil thoughts, and more so than man can see our evil actions:
yet nevertheless poor blind forgetful man will please and entertain
himself with abundance of evil thoughts in the open view
of his Maker, while at the same time he would dread to expose
them by overt acts, in the view of men. This shows how much
more predominant the fear of man is with the most of mankind,
than the fear of God their Creator. I hope the opportunity was
profitable and instructive to some present.</p>

<p>Second day, the 9th. I rode to New-York in order to attend
the meeting for sufferings which came the next day, and which I
attended accordingly. After this I spent several days in the city
and neighbourhood, in prosecuting the concern I opened before
our last monthly meeting. My kinsman Isaac Hicks accompanied
me.</p>

<p>I attended Pearl-street meeting as it came in course on fourth
day, and had an appointed meeting at the same place in the
evening, for the inhabitants of the town at large. It was a very
full meeting, many more collected than the house could contain.
The next day I attended Friends’ meeting at Manhattanville,
and in the evening had a public meeting in the city, at Friends’
meeting-house in Liberty-street. These were all full favoured
meetings, in which truth reigned and subjected, at least for the
present, all contrary spirits, which was cause of humble thankfulness
to my mind.</p>

<p>We left the city on sixth day and had an appointed meeting
at Brooklyn in the evening. On seventh day we had two meetings
in Newtown, the first at Friends’ meeting-house at the
Kilns, and the latter at the town in the evening. These three
last meetings were principally made up of people of other societies,
who behaved very commendably and appeared well affected with
the meetings; and truth’s testimonies were largely and satisfactorily
opened in each meeting, comforting and contriting many
hearts, and to the solid peace of my own mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[Pg 328]</span></p>

<p>On first day, the 15th, I attended Friends’ meeting at Flushing,
and some notice having been spread of my coming, it was
large; and was added to by a number from Newtown, of other
societies who had attended the two meetings held there the
day before. This was also an open instructive meeting, in
which divers doctrines of the gospel were communicated in the
life, to the edification of the people. The next day I returned
home and found my family well, which, with the peace of mind
that accompanied, produced thankfulness of heart to the blessed
Author of all our mercies and blessings.</p>

<p>Fifth day. I attended our monthly meeting. It was rather a
dull exercising season, in which I was led into some painful
labour.</p>

<p>On sixth day, I proceeded again on the visit to some of the
neighbouring inhabitants. Had an appointed meeting in the
evening at Hempstead Harbour, and the next evening at the
lower part of Cowneck. Both were full meetings. In the former
I was largely opened by way of testimony, and many important
doctrines of the gospel were communicated for the instruction
and edification of the people, and I left them with peace of mind.
In the latter I was mostly silent. On first day I attended Friends’
meeting at Cowneck, which was well attended; many of the
neighbouring inhabitants coming in that were not members,
who behaved soberly. It was a favoured satisfactory season, in
which truth reigned.</p>

<p>In the evening I had a pretty large instructive meeting in the
village of Herricks. It was a solemn time, in which many truths
of the gospel were clearly opened, apparently to the satisfaction
and edification of the assembly in general, and I returned home
next morning with peace of mind.</p>

<p>On fourth day I attended Bethpage meeting, at which there
was a marriage, which occasioned the meeting to be very large.
I think it was much the largest I had ever seen in that place.
There was a large number of young people, and although many
of them appeared raw and undisciplined, yet they generally
behaved orderly during the meeting, and I had a pretty open
time among them. I was led to set forth the nature and dignity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[Pg 329]</span>
of the marriage covenant when rightly entered into, and the sad
reverse, when rashly and unadvisedly undertaken; and especially
so when unequally yoked together, and of different persuasions
as to religion: for being disunited in the main point, it
most certainly must tend to disturb their quiet and imbitter their
enjoyments. And the offspring of such connexions are greatly
to be pitied; attached by nature to both parents, how confused
must be their ideas with regard to which they shall follow; and
as it often happens, the boys going with their father, and the
daughters with their mother; hence, children which ought to be
bound together in the strongest ties of natural affection and consanguinity,
are in early life divided in principle and in conduct,
by which they become alienated from each other. To avoid
which the youth were earnestly and affectionately invited and
admonished to put in practice the exhortation of Jesus Christ to
his immediate followers, and the people which resorted to hear
him, viz: To seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness,
in a full belief that as we comply therewith, all other things
needful and consolatory will be added.</p>

<p>I attended our own meeting the next day in silence, and feeling
a stop in my mind as to proceeding further at present in the
visit before me, I turned my attention to my family concerns, not
being willing to spend any of my precious time in idleness.</p>

<p>First day. Sat our meeting in silence. It is a precious thing
and very consoling, to all Zion’s exercised travellers in the path
of duty, to be instructed how and when to speak, and when to
keep silence.</p>

<p>Fifth day. A silent meeting. Spent the rest of the week in
attention to my family concerns.</p>

<p>First day, the 8th of 3d month. A favoured open time in our
meeting to-day, in which the gospel was preached in its own
authority, and in which the excellency and reality of the divine
principle of grace and truth was opened and explained; showing
it to be the same breath of life which was breathed into man on
the day of his creation, and which constituted the divine image
in man, and is the Lamb or innocent life of God, and which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[Pg 330]</span>
innocent life was slain in our first parents by their first transgression.
Hence it is called the Lamb slain from the foundation of
the world, agreeably to the scriptures; but no otherwise slain
than by man’s rejecting it, and turning away from it, into the
serpentine wisdom; by which man became dead to this divine
life, and that dead to him. Hence the denunciation was fulfilled
on man, in the day thou eatest thereof, that is, in the day thou
turnest away from this divine life, and presumest to know good
and evil for thyself, thou shalt, or wilt, surely die; which was
accordingly fulfilled on our first parents in the day of their
transgression, and consequently on all their offspring who have
followed their example. Agreeably to the apostle Paul’s doctrine,
it then follows, that as in Adam all die, that is, as in our transgressing
like Adam, we take upon us Adam’s nature in the fall,
which nature is a state of death; so on the contrary, as we turn
inward to the divine light and law, and repent of our transgressions,
and become sincerely obedient thereunto, by denying ourselves
and taking up our cross daily, we then come into the
obedience of Christ; not doing our own will, but the will of our
heavenly Father. We then put on Christ and become partakers
of his divine nature, and thereby come to witness in our own
experience, not only that in Adam, that is, in Adam’s nature in
the fall, which we have taken upon us by our own transgression,
and not by Adam’s, we die or witness a state of death to the
divine nature: so likewise in our coming into the obedience of
Christ, we take upon us his divine nature; and are thereby made
alive and come to witness the Lamb which was slain in us,
while we remained in Adam’s nature, to rise from the dead and
become Christ in us the hope of glory, or the Lamb of God which
taketh away the sin of the world. Therefore all the varied
names given in scripture to this divine light and life, such as
Emmanuel, Jesus, sent of God, great Prophet, Christ our Lord,
Grace, Unction, Anointed, &amp;c. mean one and the same thing;
and are nothing less nor more, than the spirit and power of God
in the soul of man, as his Creator, Preserver, Condemner, Redeemer,
Saviour, Sanctifier and Justifier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[Pg 331]</span></p>

<p>Spent the rest of the week at and about home. Attended our
preparative meeting on fifth day. The meeting for worship I
sat mostly in silence.</p>

<p>First day, the 15th. In the course of our meeting I felt constrained
to communicate some plain truths in doctrine and in
caution, to the unguarded and refractory; but which seemed too
much to rebound, for want of a disposition in such to receive the
word preached, as they are apt to kick against the truth when it
is plainly told them; this causes hard labour to the messengers,
who, although they feel the woe and are constrained to labour,
yet find little satisfaction therein, except in the consciousness of
having faithfully done their duty to their careless and deficient
brethren and fellow creatures.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I proceeded in the concern before expressed,
in visiting some of the neighbouring inhabitants. Had an
appointed meeting at Jerusalem in the evening, and on second
day, a meeting about four miles westerly from thence. On third
day I had one further on, in a southwesterly direction, among a
people in moderate circumstances as to this world, but whose
minds seemed generally open to receive the doctrines of truth. I
also had a meeting in the evening of this day in the town of
Hempstead. These were all large favoured meetings, especially
the last, which was unusually so, and in which the truths of the
gospel were largely communicated, apparently to the satisfaction
and edification of the assembly, and to the peace of my own
mind. We returned home the next day, attending Westbury
monthly meeting in our way.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended our monthly meeting. In the meeting
for worship I was led to open to Friends the many precious advantages
and privileges resulting from a firm faith and sincere trust
in the Almighty Jehovah. For thereby we come to witness all
those great and precious promises fulfilled which the scriptures
mention, and know in our own experience that they who trust
in the Lord are never confounded.</p>

<p>The rest of the week I was busily employed in a variety of
temporal concerns, as I find no time to be idle, either in body
or mind, for nothing affords so much true peace as a con<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[Pg 332]</span>sciousness
of the right improvement and employment of precious
time.</p>

<p>First day, the 22d. By previous appointment I attended a
meeting at the house of our friend James Rushmore, at the Halfway
Hollow Hills, at the eleventh hour, and in the evening at a
place called Babylon, on the south side of the Island. These meetings,
by the extreme inclemency of the weather, were small, especially
the first, where it was like the two or three as to number, yet
I found a good degree of satisfaction in faithfully attending to the
appointment, although I had to ride a dozen miles or more
through the storm, which was so extreme as to prevent nearly
all the neighbours from attending the meeting, and in our passing
from one meeting to the other, the wind blew with such
violence, that our carriage seemed several times near blowing
over; but we got along safe, and had a comfortable meeting at
the latter place in the evening. After this I rode to my son-in-law
Joshua Willits’, at Islip, and lodged. I spent most of the
next day at his house, and on third day at the eleventh hour had
a pretty large favoured meeting at the house of our friend Thomas
Whitson, at Oysterbay South. After this I returned home.</p>

<p>In our fifth day meeting I was made an example of silence.</p>

<p>First day, the 29th. In our meeting to-day I was led into an
enlightened view of the excellency of faith, and its blessed effects
on the minds of those who come to witness its lively operation.</p>

<p>The subject opened to communication in a large affecting testimony,
recapitulating its wonder-working power in the holy
ancients, and showing that its efficacy was the same now as in
former days, to those who become rightly initiated into it through
faithful obedience to divine requiring, as nothing else will establish
us in that living faith which works by love, and gives victory over
the world.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended Friends’ meeting at Martinicock, in
which I was an example of silence. At the second hour in the
afternoon, I attended the funeral of Charles Thorne, a person
inclining to Friends, in the neighbourhood of Moscheto Cove.
There was a large collection of the neighbours, among whom I
was led to communicate and open divers essential doctrines of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[Pg 333]</span>
the gospel, and to set forth the design and end of the types and
shadows of the law dispensation given to Israel, and to Israel
only; and to show that they were finished and abolished by the
introduction of the gospel state, or the diffusion of the spirit of
truth, or Holy Ghost, in the minds of the believers, by which
only we can come to have a living faith made perfect by good
works, because faith without works is dead.</p>

<p>First day, the 5th of 4th month. A silent meeting to-day.
This week busily employed in my temporal concerns, even so as
to occasion wearisomeness at times. What a comfortable state
would even this world afford, if men and women were all
honest enough to do their light portion of labour, for want of
which thousands in every country are inventing pitiful and
unrighteous schemes to obtain a livelihood from the labours of
others. These, let them be high or low, learned or unlearned,
rich or poor, make up that class of mankind, who grievously
oppress and grind the faces of the poor.</p>

<p>First day, the 12th. I had a precious open time in our meeting
to-day, in which I was led largely to open many truths of the
gospel, in a clear instructive manner, which brought a precious
solemnity over the meeting, and which closed under the sensible
covering of divine favour.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended our monthly meeting. It was the time
for preparing answers to the queries to go up to the yearly meeting,
and was, I believe, a season of profitable exercise.</p>

<p>First day, the 19th. I had good service in our meeting to-day,
and through the overshadowing wing of divine kindness, it
proved a precious opportunity. In the course of this week I
attended our quarterly meeting, held at this time in New-York.
It was a favoured season in the several sittings of it, affording
encouragement to the honest-hearted, to persevere on in their
heavenly way without turning aside to the right hand or the left,
through fear, favour or affection. The labour in the line of communication
fell mostly to my lot.</p>

<p>First day, the 26th. I was made an example of silence
through our meeting to-day. Nothing of particular notice occurred
in the course of this week.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[Pg 334]</span></p>

<p>First day, the 3d of 5th month. I attended the funeral of our
ancient worthy friend Jacob Underhill, of Cedar Swamp. There
was a very large collection of Friends and neighbours assembled
on the occasion, he being very generally beloved and esteemed by
his acquaintance and Friends. A very solemn meeting was held
at the meeting-house at Martinicock, on the occasion, in which I
was largely led forth in ministry and doctrine, so that many hearts
were contrited, to the general satisfaction and edification of the
assembly, and to the peace of my own mind.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I had an appointed meeting at the house of
Amos Cheshire, about four miles easterly from our village.
Through divine favour it was made an instructive, profitable
season, in which truth was exalted over all opposition.</p>

<p>Fifth day. I attended the funeral of my kinswoman the widow
Sarah Albertson. A solemn meeting was held on the occasion,
at Friends’ meeting-house at Westbury, in which I had good service.
I was led to open in a clear manner, the superiour excellence
of the divine principle of light and truth, borne testimony
to by the society ever since we have been a people, and showing
that, where that is wanting, or is not given heed to, every thing
else will and must fail of effecting the great work of our salvation,
as no other means are adequate to that end. It was a season of
favour, in which I was largely opened to declare of the things
concerning the kingdom of heaven, and to open to the people
many truths of the gospel, in the demonstration of the spirit,
accompanied with power; which solemnized and tendered many
minds. Surely it was the Lord’s doing, and to him belongs all
the praise: nothing due to man.</p>

<p>First day, the 10th. A hard trying meeting, mostly silent.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Had the acceptable company of our friend Mary
Naftel, from England. She laboured in the ability afforded for
our help and encouragement, which honest travail does not
fail of meeting its own reward, true peace of mind, the richest
treasure.</p>

<p>First day, the 17th. Silent in our meeting to-day.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended our monthly meeting, at which we had
the company of our esteemed friend Phebe Field from Scipio.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[Pg 335]</span>
Her company, together with her lively, simple, plain testimony,
corresponding with our profession, were truly acceptable and
refreshing.</p>

<p>Seventh day, the 23d. I left home early in the morning in
order to attend our yearly meeting, accompanied by my wife and
daughter Elizabeth. We arrived in New-York in time to attend
the first sitting of the meeting of Ministers and Elders, which
opened at the tenth hour. The meeting for discipline opened the
following second day at ten o’clock, and closed on fifth day evening.
It was shorter as to time than usual; but I think, in the
main, it was a favoured meeting, and closed well, under an humbling
sense of divine condescension and regard, and Friends separated
to their several homes, under a feeling sense of brotherly love.</p>

<p>First day, the 31st. Attended our meeting in silence, and in
much poverty of spirit, and although we had the company of a
Friend who was travelling in the ministry, and who appeared
pretty large in testimony; yet it seemed void of life to me, which
I was willing to conclude was my own fault. We had another
meeting appointed at the fourth hour in the afternoon, by two
women Friends from West Jersey. This was also a meeting of
exercise to me, without laying any thing to the charge of my
friends.</p>

<p>Fifth day. A silent meeting. The rest of the week laboriously
exercised in my temporal concerns. Oh how killing too
much bodily labour is to our best spiritual life, and although it
may be no more than is our duty to do, in order comfortably to
accommodate our families, and the timely payment of our just
debts, and the punctual performance of all our contracts, yet even
then divine wisdom has so wisely ordered the events of things, as
to impress caution on our minds, by not suffering us to reap much
spiritual content or inward enjoyment from bodily exercise, or
worldly care, lest as man is naturally prone to seek earthly things,
he might become so swallowed up in his temporal enjoyments, as
to neglect the one thing needful, that of laying up treasure in
heaven.</p>

<p>First day, the 7th of 6th month. We had a large meeting
to-day, and having been made an example of silence for a number<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[Pg 336]</span>
of meeting days past, I also looked for the same at this time, till
nearly half the time of our meeting was expired. I sat clothed
in darkness, a darkness which could be felt; but after wrestling
for about an hour a gleam of light sprang up, and a prospect
revived, which had presented at the opening of the meeting, and
enlarged with increasing weight until it led to communication.
In the course thereof, the original state of man was considered,
and presented to the view of the audience; and the state of rectitude
in which he was placed by his gracious Creator; also the
way shown, by and through which he fell, in a way clearly to
discharge and exculpate the all-equitable and perfect Jehovah
from any blame, as having any part or hand in man’s fall and
ruin, and placing it wholly on his own turpitude, by making a
wrong use of his liberty, and by making his election to evil instead
of good, when both lay open before him, at his own choice.
Therefore, if he would pursue evil instead of good, he had none
to blame but himself: the Lord would be clear, and his faithful
servants would be clear; his blood will be upon his own head.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended our preparative meeting. My exercise
and testimony led to show the excellency and necessity of silence
to man, in all his attempts to approach the divine Being in solemn
spiritual worship; not only the body but also the mind must be
silenced, according to that saying of the prophet, “Be still and
know that I am God;” with which the testimony of Christ well
agrees, where he assures his disciples, “That he is the vine, and
they are the branches; and except the branch abide in the vine
it withereth,” and that “without him they can do nothing.” As
it is the sap from the vine that can only quicken and vivify the
branch; so nothing short of the will, life and power of the Creator,
spiritually dispensed to the creature, can enable him to perform
worship in spirit and in truth. For nothing but man’s assuming
an independent will, in opposition to the divine will, and becoming
active therein, occasioned his fall and separation from his Maker;
so likewise nothing but a renunciation of that will, and a cessation
from all self-activity as an independent creature, can unite
and restore him again, or enable him to worship in spirit and in
truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[Pg 337]</span></p>

<p>First day, the 14th. Having not fully performed my contemplated
visit to our neighbouring towns and villages, and way
opening for a further procedure, I attended two appointed meetings
to-day, one in the morning at Cold Spring, and the other at
the fourth hour in the afternoon at Huntington. Both these were
pretty full meetings, in which my exercise was laborious, but I
had a hope they were profitable meetings to some present. I
returned home in the evening.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended our monthly meeting, at which we had
the company of a Friend from Pennsylvania. His plain lively
testimony, together with his company and solid deportment, did
my heart good, as it brought to my remembrance some of our
primitive worthies.</p>

<p>Sixth day. I attended the funeral of our friend Jacob Smith
of Westbury. His death was very sudden and unexpected,
which made it the more trying to his family. A meeting was
held on the occasion, which was largely attended by his friends
and the neighbouring inhabitants. The opportunity was solemn
and instructive, and the gospel was preached in the demonstration
of the spirit, and many hearts were humbled and contrited.
Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift.</p>

<p>First day, the 21st. I proceeded again in order to accomplish
my aforesaid visit to the neighbouring towns and villages. By
previous notice, a meeting was appointed at Cow Harbour, about
twelve miles to the eastward, at the fourth hour in the afternoon,
at the house of a person by the name of Henry Scudder, which
was large and favoured. The five following days, I attended
meetings appointed at the following places, viz: at Elias Smith’s,
in the west part of Smithtown, on second day, at the fourth hour
in the afternoon; at the Branch on third day, at the eleventh
hour; at Stony Brook, on fourth day at eleven o’clock; at
Setauket on the same day, at the fourth hour in the afternoon;
on fifth day had one at a place called the Hopfrogs, at the fourth
hour in the afternoon; on sixth day at the eleventh hour, one
near Commack, at the house of our friend Jacob Harnad, and at
the fourth hour, had our last meeting in this town, at the house
of Jonah Wood, at Dixhills. This is a grandson of Jonah Wood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[Pg 338]</span>
deceased, who resided in the same place, where I often had meetings
while he was living. He was a man convinced of the principles
of Friends, but never came forward to join the society,
which I apprehended was a loss to himself and family. These
meetings were all owned by the Master of our assemblies, although
great weakness and ignorance were manifest in many who
attended, nevertheless the Lord was graciously pleased to condescend
to their low estates, and opened my mouth in doctrine suited
to their states and conditions. I returned home on seventh day,
with a thankful heart and a peaceful mind, the result of faithfulness
in the Lord’s work.</p>

<p>First day, the 28th. Attended our own meeting, which I sat
the greater part in silence; but towards the close had a short
testimony to deliver, which was introduced by the remembrance
of the account given by the evangelist of the pool of Bethesda,
and our Lord’s healing the impotent man who had long waited
there to be healed, but was not; therefore our Lord had compassion
on him, and healed him. This shows how good it is to
have a steady persevering faith and hope in the means God
appoints for our salvation.</p>

<p>Fifth day. A silent meeting. The rest of the week I was
busily employed in the oversight of my hay harvest, and in
assisting in getting it into the barn; the fields having brought
forth bountifully, which greatly enhances our obligations to the
benevolent Giver.</p>

<p>First day, the 5th of 7th month. My mind in our meeting
to-day, was humbled under an awakened sense of my own
imperfections, and the impotency of our common nature. In
this humiliated state, my mind became clothed with the spirit of
prayer and supplication, which gave utterance vocally to present
a petition to our heavenly Father for the continuance of his
mercy; and that he would increase our faith and confident
dependance on him, as our only source of help and salvation.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended our preparative meeting. The meeting
for worship was a lively meeting, although silent or nearly so.
The diffusion of real friendship and brotherly love was warmly
felt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[Pg 339]</span></p>

<p>First day, the 12th. I sat our meeting in silence, endeavouring
to be edified by a communication from a young minister
from Cowneck, which was sensible and in a good degree lively.
How much more comfortable it is to sit under a testimony that
comprehends good sense, and by which the understanding of the
people is spoken to, than such as are delivered in a high sound
of many words, and yet so unconnected, as to render it difficult to
comprehend the subject matter the speaker really aims at; or such
as are delivered in a kind of prophetic strain, without power, which
some speakers are too apt to fall into; so that we are sometimes
ready to doubt their call to that highly important and dignified
office. These often cause deep exercise and concern to the
living baptized members.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended our monthly meeting, at which the
queries were read and the usual number answered, in order to
represent our state to the quarterly meeting. Things appeared
well with us, if the answers given in, were a true representation
of our state.</p>

<p>First day, the 19th. I was again made an example of silence.
In the course of this week our quarterly meeting was held. It was,
I think, in the main a favoured season, in which divine goodness
manifested a renewed extension of unmerited mercy to us poor,
helpless and unworthy creatures. We had at this quarterly
meeting the company of our esteemed friend Gerard T. Hopkins
from Baltimore. He appeared lively in his gift, to our mutual
edification.</p>

<p>It fell to my lot in the meeting for discipline, to revive the concern
for the melioration of the condition of the Africans and their
descendants; not only as it respected those who are still held in
a state of abject bondage and oppression, but also on behalf of
those who have been set free, but who, nevertheless continue, in
a very general manner, in a degraded and helpless state, for want
of being placed upon the ground of equality with the rest of the
inhabitants, as strict justice would dictate, if rightly adhered to
by the people and government. And I am fully in the belief,
that divine justice will not be satisfied, nor the black stain of
shedding innocent blood and cruelly oppressing this people,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[Pg 340]</span>
ever be taken from the inhabitants of this land, until strict justice
is done them, and they placed by the laws of our country, in
the same state of equality in every respect as the rest of its
inhabitants, and in the enjoyment of the full right of civilized
man. This is their just and righteous due, and these privileges,
if duly and rightly administered to them, would bring them to be
as good and useful citizens as those of any other nation.</p>

<p>I was also led to call upon my Friends to persevere in this
noble and righteous concern, that nothing might be left undone
on our part, in restoring strict justice and right to this deeply
oppressed part of our fellow creatures; not only on their account
and for their relief, but on our own account also. For, I believe,
we are in a very peculiar manner called upon, agreeably to our
profession, of being led and guided by an unerring principle of
perfect righteousness, to exalt the standard of truth and righteousness
in the earth: and believing, as I do, that it is not in
the power and wisdom of man to effect this, by all the coercive
laws which can be enacted, nor by all the force of the arm of
flesh. For nothing can destroy and put an end to sin and wickedness,
but a principle in man of perfect righteousness and justice;
and this adhered to by man in so full and complete a
manner, as to have no fellowship or communion, either immediately
or remotely, directly or indirectly, with any acts of injustice
or oppression. Hence, I believe, that if we as a people were faithful
and obedient to this first principle of our profession, we should
be led thereby to abstain from all kinds of commerce or dealings
in the produce of our country or elsewhere, which we had cause
to believe originated out of, or through the medium of, the labour
of slaves, wrung from them and sold by their tyrannical masters.
And I am well assured that nothing short of such an exalted
testimony to truth and righteousness will ever put a full end to
oppression and injustice; and, I believe, He who called our worthy
predecessors to exalt the testimony of truth in the earth, and who
is still calling us to advocate this noble cause, is looking for this
testimony of strict justice and righteousness at our hands.</p>

<p>O, saith my soul! that we as a people, called as we are to
be a light to the world, might so persevere in faithfulness and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[Pg 341]</span>
obedience to the teachings and inspirings of light and truth in
our hearts, by which we should be enabled to unite together for
the exaltation of this noble testimony, and the increase of the
Messiah’s kingdom of truth, righteousness, and peace in the earth;
and which in its progression will break down and dissolve all
the kingdoms of this world, until they become the kingdoms of
our Lord and of his Christ, and he comes to reign whose right
it is.</p>

<p>The subject spread with unusual weight over the meeting, and
many brethren appeared deeply affected therewith, and divers
came forward by expression to encourage its progress, and to stimulate
each other therein; so that my heart was truly gladdened
under a sense of the prevalence of truth, which was felt to preside
in the meeting, clearly manifesting that the concern was owned
by the Head of the Church.</p>

<p>First day, the 26th. A silent meeting to-day. Passed this
week in much poverty of spirit, accompanied with a peaceful
mind. Sat our fifth day meeting in solemn silence.</p>

<p>First day, the 2d of 8th month. Feeling my mind disposed
to sit with Friends in their meeting at Bethpage, I went thither
to-day accompanied by my wife. Although my mind felt rather
depressed from a sense of the low state of things among them,
yet I was led to communicate some plain things; showing that
true religion did not consist in going to meetings and making a
profession of it, but in works of real righteousness, and in a
strict and daily conformity and submission to the cross, and a
steady obedience to the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus,
which only can set free from the law of sin and death.</p>

<p>Fifth day. A silent meeting on my part. The rest of the
week I was taken up in temporal matters, having workmen of
various kinds to overlook and assist, even at times to a degree of
wearisomeness; insomuch that was it not from the calls of necessity
and duty, I should endeavour to quit them all and be free
from their cumber and interruption; as they do often interfere
with better concerns, and those of a higher and more excellent
nature.</p>

<p>First day, the 9th. A silent meeting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>[Pg 342]</span></p>

<p>Fifth day. Was our preparative meeting. Silence was my
lot in the meeting for worship.</p>

<p>First day, the 16th. Our meeting was larger than usual by
the attendance of strangers, who did not usually attend. Very
soon after taking my seat, my mind was impressed with a view
of the baneful tendency of pride, and its hurtful effects on the
children of men universally. The prospect led to communication,
and opened into a pretty full testimony, tendering and humbling
many minds. May it fasten as a nail in a sure place, that
so it may continue in remembrance for many days and bring
forth fruit, is my fervent prayer.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended our monthly meeting. In the meeting
for worship I renewed the example to silence.</p>

<p>First day, the 23d. In the course of our meeting, my mind
was led into a view of the necessity of the cross, consistent with
that saying of the lip of truth: “If any man will come after me,
let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.” The
subject spread and led to the necessity of communication, in
which the way and work, and its effect upon the man of sin or self,
was opened; showing that when the cross is submitted to and
borne, the transgressing nature in us is reduced and subjected
by the operation of its power, through which true liberty is
known, and the captive soul set free, and made to rejoice on the
banks of deliverance.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended our meeting in silence. In the afternoon
attended the funeral of a man inclined to Friends, at which
there was a large collection of people of various professions. My
mouth was opened to testify among them of the things concerning
the kingdom of heaven, and to open the way of life and
salvation to the people, and the only means by which it ever was
or can be effected, viz: by the grace of God or light of truth,
revealed in the hearts and consciences of men and women, as a
swift witness against all manner of sin and iniquity. Life sprang
up and the gospel was preached in the demonstration of the
spirit, wherewith many were affected and edified.</p>

<p>First day, the 30th. The consideration of the great advantages
which would result to the children of men, were they pos<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[Pg 343]</span>sessed
of right ideas, and a right understanding of the divine
character opened to an exercise and concern, from an impressive
belief that there was a great shortness in that respect, even among
professing Christians in a general way; and a great want of a
right improvement of the talent or talents dispensed by our gracious
Creator to his creature man, or that manifestation of the
spirit given to every man to profit withal. For this, if rightly
improved, would bring us to know and witness the true and
saving knowledge of God, and give us right ideas of the divine
character; and by which, if rightly adhered to, our salvation
would be effected. I was led to communicate on the subject,
which brought a very comfortable solemnity over the meeting.</p>

<p>Fifth day, the 3d of 9th month. A silent meeting to-day.</p>

<p>First day, the 6th. Having for some days past felt drawings
on my mind to attend Friends’ meeting at Westbury, and way
opening for it to-day, I went thither accompanied by my wife.
It was rather a trying exercising season in the forepart, but towards
the close my spirit was set at liberty, and an opening presented,
attended with life; in which I was led to open and show to those
present, the necessity of an entire renunciation of self, in order to
come to a saving knowledge of God, and a qualification to worship
him in spirit and in truth; and of an entire cessation from all
our own willings and runnings, both in body and spirit and in
thought. Although this is an attainment which man cannot arrive
at by the dint of his own sufficiency, yet, nevertheless he may,
by a right faith in God and in the sufficiency of his power.
Therefore we ought not to let in discouragement from a sense
of our own impotent state, but continue to strive to enter in at
the straight gate of self-abasement and renunciation, and persevere
therein, leaving the rest to the Lord; and then, no doubt,
we may be brought to the experience of one formerly who exclaimed:
“Thou wilt ordain peace for us, for thou also hast wrought
all our works in us.”</p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended our meeting as usual when at home. I
was much cumbered in the forepart of the meeting with unprofitable
thoughts, such as relate to our temporal concerns. For these
produce poverty of spirit in religious meetings, and ought to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344"></a>[Pg 344]</span>
strove against in order to obtain a release from them: and, although
it is what we cannot do in our own time and strength, yet as we
continue to strive and do not give over the struggle, but persevere
in faith and patience to obtain the blessing, as Jacob did when
he wrestled with the angel, we shall witness an overcoming in
the Lord’s time and strength, and know our light to rise out of
obscurity, and our darkness to be as noonday. Then are we
qualified to worship the Father in spirit and in truth, in the
beauty of holiness, and nothing can hinder or let. Then can
we do the Lord’s work with a willing heart agreeably to his will,
without the fear or favour of mortals. We can then minister, if
called thereto, in the demonstration of the spirit, accompanied
with power, which causes it to be instructive and edifying to the
hearers.</p>

<p>First day, the 13th. My mind, as I sat in our meeting to-day,
was led under exercise from the remembrance of the following
passage of Isaiah: “Look unto me and be ye saved, all ye ends
of the earth; for I am God, and there is none else.” I was
largely opened on the subject, and as I communicated, truth was
raised into dominion; whereby the minds of many were humbled
and contrited, the meeting generally solemnized and edified,
and sweet peace afforded me in the labour.</p>

<p>Fifth day. This was the time of our monthly meeting. We
had the company of our friend William Rickman from England,
now on a religious visit in this country. Having felt my mind
drawn for some considerable time past, to make a visit in the love
of the gospel, to Friends in the compass of our yearly meeting,
with a view also to appoint some meetings among those of other
persuasions, it appeared right to spread the concern before my
Friends at this time; who, after due consideration, united with
me therein, and directed the clerk to furnish me with a minute
of concurrence with my prospect, leaving me at liberty to pursue
it as truth might open the way.</p>

<p>Fifth day, the 24th. A quiet silent meeting. On seventh day
I attended the funeral of a young Friend, a kinsman, who, for
more than a year previous to his dissolution, had been in a
declining state of health. There was a large collection of Friends<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[Pg 345]</span>
and neighbours on the occasion. The corpse was taken into
the meeting-house, and a meeting held before it was interred,
which is mostly the case among Friends in this part of the
society. It proved a very exercising season in the forepart,
and although divers ministers were present, yet all seemed shut
from any communication, until the meeting seemed drawing to
a conclusion, when my mind was set at liberty from its bonds,
and a degree of light arose and dispelled the darkness, in which
I was led to open the cause and ground of the prevailing darkness
which had been so generally spread over us; and to
show that it was owing to the people’s living too much to self,
and serving self, when they ought more faithfully to serve the
Lord and live unto him. I was led, in a brief way, in a close,
searching testimony, which I hope will have its use, at least with
some present.</p>

<p>First day, the 27th. In our meeting to-day, my mind was
largely opened into the substance of things referred to by the
shadows and symbols of the law, or outward dispensation. As
the prospect spread and enlarged, I found it necessary to spread it
before the assembly, and to show the difference between the law
state and that of the gospel, and that as the shadows and symbols
of the outward law dispensation, stood and consisted in real essential
and substantial things, suited to our outward nature and life;
so likewise the substance of those shadows, as they were intended
to point to spiritual things, must also consist in real, essential and
substantial things, suited to our inward and spiritual nature and
life, and therefore of course all the shadows of the law are at an
end, where the gospel state is known and experienced. It was a
season of favour, and renewedly strengthening to my mind, and
I believe, instructive and edifying to many present. Thanks be
given to Israel’s Shepherd, for his continued mercy.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended our preparative meeting, at which the
queries were read, and answers given to the usual five, to go
to the quarterly meeting; and I thought, from the tenour of the
answers, if correct, we were a favoured people.</p>

<p>First day, the 11th. Our meeting was large, in which the gospel
axe was laid close to the root of the corrupt tree; showing that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[Pg 346]</span>
every tree which did not bring forth good fruit must be hewn
down, let it have ever so specious an outward appearance.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended our monthly meeting, at which answers
to the queries were produced from the preparative meetings.
Although I feared the answers from our preparative meeting made
us appear more correct than we really were, yet those from the
other branch of the monthly meeting were still more perfect, and
although I felt some doubting, yet a degree of gladness attended
in a hope that we were improving.</p>

<p>After this meeting, nothing in particular transpired, until I proceeded
on my intended journey, which was on the 21st of 10th
month, 1818, and fourth day of the week. Samuel Willis, a
member of our meeting, and an elder, joined me as a companion.
We proceeded to Flushing, in order to attend our quarterly meeting,
which opened with a meeting of Ministers and Elders at the
tenth hour. The next day was the meeting for discipline, and
the day following a public meeting for worship. Through the
condescending goodness of the Shepherd of Israel, the several
seasons were truly comfortable, instructive and edifying, in which
the power of truth was exalted over all opposition, to the praise
of Him who is calling us to glory and virtue.</p>

<p>From Flushing we proceeded to Newtown, on sixth day afternoon,
and attended a public meeting in the evening, of those
belonging to other societies.</p>

<p>The next day we had an appointed meeting in Friends’ meeting-house
at the Kilns, and another in the evening at Brooklyn,
generally composed of those not in membership with us, and
many not in strict fellowship with any religious society. And we
had thankfully to acknowledge, that He who opens and none can
shut, was graciously near for our help, and opened doctrine suited
to the states of those who attended in the several opportunities, to
the peace and comfort of my own mind, and, I trust, to the
instruction and edification of the people.</p>

<p>From thence we proceeded to New-York, and attended the
meetings in the city, on first day. They were large: many not
in profession with us came in, as previous information had been
given of our intention to be there. The gospel was freely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[Pg 347]</span>
preached among them in both opportunities, particularly that at
Pearl-street, wherein truth was raised into dominion over all.</p>

<p>On second day we attended a meeting by appointment at West Chester,
which was also a precious edifying opportunity. After
this we proceeded to Purchase, in order to attend the quarterly
meeting at that place, which opened the next day at the eleventh
hour, and continued three days. The meeting for discipline was
well conducted, in which I was led to call upon Friends, to rally
to our standard, the <i>light within</i>, which is a principle of perfect
rectitude and justice, and if rightly attended to, will lead us to
withdraw from all kind of conduct and commerce, which is in
the least degree tinged with injustice and oppression. And in a
particular manner from a commerce in, and the use of, articles
which are the product of the labour of slaves; the injustice of
which was clearly opened and brought home to Friends’ minds,
showing them that nothing short of a principle of immutable justice,
which may so pervade the minds of mankind, as not to have
any intercourse with the oppressor, in the produce of the labour
of the oppressed, will ever be sufficient fully to suppress that
monstrous evil, and put a final end thereto. It was a very
solemn season. The meeting for worship was likewise favoured,
in which the divine presence was witnessed for our help and
comfort.</p>

<p>The four following days we attended meetings at North Castle,
Salem, Oblong and the Branch. These were all large for the
places, and favoured with the overshadowing of heavenly regard,
in which ability was received to preach the gospel, in the demonstration
of the spirit, and wisdom afforded to divide the word to
the different states of those present. Each meeting was composed
of a variety of professions and conditions; and such was
the gracious condescension of the Shepherd of Israel, as not to
send any away empty, if they were willing to receive the portion
justly allotted them; and if they refuse, because it is not agreeable
to their own inclinations, the Lord will be clear, and his faithful
servants will be clear; and if they are not saved, their blood will
be upon their own heads. These several seasons were comfortable
and encouraging to the honest-hearted, and strengthening to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[Pg 348]</span>
my exercised mind; a sense of which filled my heart with gratitude
and thanksgiving to the blessed Author of all our mercies.</p>

<p>After these meetings we proceeded to Nine Partners. On third
day, the 3d of 11th month, their quarterly meeting came on.
The meeting of Ministers and Elders opened at the tenth hour,
and the meeting for discipline the next day. These were both
profitable instructive meetings to many present, in which way
opened fully to relieve my own mind; and I felt sweet peace in
my labours of love among them.</p>

<p>The three following days we attended the quarterly meeting at
Stanford. I had but little active service in the meeting of Ministers
and Elders, yet I found it my place to remind Friends of the
danger and bad effects of covering or hiding, and of the advantage
of laying ourselves open to the just witness, and of entering into
an individual investigation, when answering the queries, lest we
overlook some things even in ourselves, and so make our answers
more clear than truth and equity will warrant. And when the
answers to the queries came to be read, I thought there was occasion
for the caution, as their answers were generally full and
clear.</p>

<p>In the meeting for discipline, I was led to call Friends’ attention
to the fundamental principle of our profession; and to show
the drift and design of those precious testimonies, as good fruit
naturally emanated from a good tree; especially those two, the
most noble and dignified, viz: against war and slavery. And
whether while we were actively paying taxes to civil government
for the purpose of promoting war or warlike purposes in any
degree, we were not balking our testimony in that respect; and
pulling down with one hand, what we are pretending to build
with the other. And in like manner with regard to slavery. For
although we had freed our own hands from holding, by active
force, any of this oppressed people, the Africans and their descendants,
in unconditional slavery; yet, whether so long as we voluntarily
and of choice, are engaged in a commerce in, and the free
use of the fruits of their labour, wrested from them by the iron
hand of oppression, through the medium of their cruel and unjust
masters, we are not accessary thereto, and are partakers in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[Pg 349]</span>
unrighteous traffic of dealing in our fellow creatures, and in a
great measure lay waste our testimony against slavery and
oppression. These subjects were largely opened, and the inconsistency
of such conduct placed before the minds of Friends;
accompanied with strong desires, that they might have their
proper effect, in convincing them of the unrighteousness of such
conduct.</p>

<p>The meeting for worship, or closing meeting, was mostly made
up of such as were not members. It was a favoured, solemn
meeting, and, I trust, instructive and comfortable to many present;
as it was to the satisfaction and peace of my own mind.</p>

<p>First day, the 8th of 11th month. We returned and attended
the meeting at Nine Partners. As notice was given of our intention
of attending it, it was very large; the house was filled with
a mixed company of various professions, besides Friends. I was
largely led forth among them, to declare of the things concerning
the kingdom of God. Truth was raised into dominion, and
a precious solemnity spread over the assembly. May all the
praise be ascribed to the Shepherd of Israel, for the unmerited
favour.</p>

<p>In the course of this week, after resting on second and third
days, in which time I visited some of my relatives, we attended
meetings at Chestnut Ridge, Apoquague, Beekman, and Oswego.
These meetings were generally well attended, and were, I trust,
profitable and instructive to many who attended them.</p>

<p>First day, the 15th. I attended West Branch meeting in the
morning, and that at Pleasant Valley in the evening. They
were both very crowded gatherings. At the latter meeting, there
were many more than the house could contain, composed, principally
of such as were not in membership with Friends, being of
the varied religious professions common among us; and many
who were not in strict fellowship with any. At such seasons,
where, of course, there must be a great variety of states and conditions,
I have found it necessary to dwell deep, and wait patiently
for the arising of the pure spring of gospel ministry, which alone
can enable and qualify to divide the word aright, so that each
may have his due portion, and be spoken to in his own language;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[Pg 350]</span>
a language which sets home the truth to every mind, as was the
case on the day of Pentecost.</p>

<p>On second day evening, we had a very large meeting in
Poughkeepsie. It was held in their court-house, which was a
very commodious room for the purpose, being well seated, and was
thought sufficient to hold nearly a thousand people. It was much
crowded, and proved a very solemn, quiet opportunity, in which
truth had the dominion.</p>

<p>The five succeeding days, we attended a large meeting by
appointment at Crum-elbow, the monthly meetings of Oswego,
Nine Partners, Creek, and Stanford. In all these meetings I
had good service; the several opportunities being favoured with
the overshadowings of heavenly regard.</p>

<p>First day, the 22d. We had a very crowded meeting at
Little Nine Partners. The next day we were at an appointed
meeting, in Friends’ meeting-house, in the town of Northeast,
which was likewise a very full meeting. In both of these the
gospel was freely preached, and its doctrines largely opened,
and set home to the minds of the people; and the fallacy and
and emptiness of all formal and ceremonial religion exposed, and
the people pressingly invited to gather inward, to the immutable
principle of <i>light</i> and <i>truth</i> in their own souls, as the <i>sure rock
of ages</i>, and the <i>only means</i> whereby we can be enabled to
work out our salvation. The Lord’s power was felt eminently
to preside in those solemn assemblies, to the praise of his great
and excellent name, who is over all worthy for ever; and I parted
with them in true peace of mind, the sure result of faithfulness.</p>

<p>On third day we rode to Canaan, a town in Connecticut, and
the next day had an appointed meeting there, with the few
Friends at that place, and some of their neighbours. It was a
comfortable, instructive season. The following day we had
another meeting by appointment, in an adjacent neighbourhood
which was held in a school-house. This was also a favoured
meeting. Divers present were much broken and contrited, and
truth reigned over all.</p>

<p>On sixth day we proceeded to Hartford, and on seventh day
evening had an appointed meeting in the city. It was held in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[Pg 351]</span>
meeting-house, belonging to the Presbyterians; as there were
only two or three members of our society in the place. The
meeting was small, occasioned, as I supposed, by the inclemency
of the weather, and want of proper notice; nevertheless the divine
presence was felt to preside, and truth was declared among them
in the demonstration of the spirit; and I parted with them, under
a thankful sense of the Lord’s mercy.</p>

<p>The next day, being the first of the week, we attended Friends’
meeting at West Hartford. This was likewise very small, Friends
being but few in number in that place, and those mostly appeared
in a lukewarm state; and I apprehended they had taken but little
care to inform their neighbours of our intention to be there, although
we had seasonably requested them so to do. Such conduct
manifests great insensibility, and want of regard for their friends
who have left all their outward enjoyments, for the promotion of
the gospel, and the religious improvement of the people; and are
going up and down in travail and labour, as with their lives in
their hands, as truth leads the way; and yet, Friends whom
they visit in some places, either think it too much trouble, or are
so unconcerned as to take little or no care to give their neighbours
notice; a sense of which caused me to take leave of my Friends
at this place with a heavy heart.</p>

<p>From thence, on second day, we proceeded to Woodbury, and
put up at the house of a person of the Methodist society, where
we had a large meeting the next evening with the neighbouring
inhabitants, composed of Methodists, Episcopalians, Presbyterians
and some others, not in strict fellowship with any religious
society. It was a very solemn, favoured meeting, in which the
Lord’s presence and power were felt eminently to preside; and
many hearts were broken and contrited, and manifested much
satisfaction with the opportunity, especially the man at whose
house we were, who in much brokenness of spirit, and with gratitude
and thankfulness of heart, acknowledged the favour.</p>

<p>The next morning, after a tendering opportunity in the family,
we took leave of them in mutual affection, and rode to Middlesex,
upwards of forty miles. Here we lodged with our kind friend
Samuel Whiting, who, with his affectionate wife and children,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352"></a>[Pg 352]</span>
received us with marks of true friendship, which is a brook by
the way to the weary traveller; and which was our case at this
time. What added further to our comfort, was the readiness of
mind and concern they manifested, in giving their neighbours
information of our intention to attend their meeting the next
day, which we accordingly did. The Lord graciously condescended
to open my mouth among them, in a living, powerful
testimony to the truths of the gospel. It was a season of great
favour. May the word preached not return void, but accomplish
that to which it was sent, is the fervent desire of my spirit.</p>

<p>After this solemn meeting we proceeded on our journey, and
rode that afternoon to our friend Charles Field’s, at a place called
the Saw <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Pitts">Pits</span>. Here we had a meeting the next day at the
eleventh hour. There is but one family of Friends in this village,
the Friend and his family above named, and one other
member. The inhabitants consist of the various professions
common among us, and some others not in communion with
any religious society. A considerable number assembled, with
whom we had a very solemn instructive opportunity, to the comfort
and peace of my own mind.</p>

<p>The evening of the next day, we had a precious favoured
meeting at Manhattanville on New-York Island, with Friends
of that place. It was attended by a considerable number of the
neighbouring inhabitants, who conducted themselves very soberly,
suiting the occasion. Many hearts were broken and contrited,
and we parted with them under an humbling sense of the Lord’s
goodness, and with grateful hearts for the unmerited favour.</p>

<p>First day, the 6th of 12th month. We rode to the city. As
Friends of the monthly meeting there had recently opened a
new meeting in the eastern part of the town, we attended it both
forenoon and afternoon. And as notice was given at the close
of the forenoon meeting of our intention to attend in the afternoon,
it was a full meeting, more than the house could well
contain. These were both memorable meetings, in which the
Lord’s presence and power were manifested in an eminent degree,
breaking and contriting many hearts, and truth reigned over all.
It was the Lord’s doing, and marvellous in our eyes, that he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[Pg 353]</span>
should thus condescend, in matchless mercy, to notice us poor
unworthy creatures.</p>

<p>At evening, we had a very large meeting by appointment, in
Friends’ meeting-house in Pearl-street. Although I was much
worn down by arduous labour in the three foregoing meetings, yet
I was strengthened to communicate in this, in a full plain testimony,
opening to the people the danger and disadvantage of
resting in the forms and empty shadows of the law state; and
continuing in the traditions and ceremonies introduced into the
professed Christian Churches, in the time of the apostacy from
primitive simplicity; and the hurtful tendency of observing days
and times, like the carnally-minded in the Galatian Church; for
which they were sharply reprehended by the apostle Paul, in his
epistle to that Church. The people were very quiet and attentive,
and a precious solemnity was spread over the meeting, which
closed in a solemn manner. Thanks be given to Israel’s unslumbering
Shepherd for the unmerited favour.</p>

<p>We tarried in town until third day, in order to attend the
meeting for sufferings which came in the course at that time.
We also had an appointed meeting in Liberty-street, on second
day evening. It was pretty well attended, in which I was led
to open to the people the way of redemption by Christ, the only
Mediator between God and man; and the way of his working
in man, in the accomplishment of his salvation. I also opened
to them the emptiness of all shadows and outward ordinances,
under the Christian dispensation; such as water baptism, and the
ordinance called the supper or communion; also the hurtful
tendency of observing days and times, such as a seventh day
sabbath, days of thanksgiving, and fast days of man’s appointing.
They were shown that all these were of Jewish or Heathenish
original, being a part of the law dispensation, and of course ended
with it, and therefore the continuance of them under the gospel
dispensation was irrational, non-essential, and contrary to truth;
tending to keep the minds of Christian professors under the veil
of carnal ordinances, and greatly retarded the progress of reformation,
and the advancement of real Christianity. I was led to use
great plainness of speech, and the people sat very quiet and atten<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[Pg 354]</span>tive,
and the word preached appeared to have free course. It
was a highly favoured season, and the honest-hearted were made
to rejoice, under an humbling sense of the Lord’s mercy, and I
parted with them in true peace of mind. The next day, after
attending the meeting for sufferings, we rode home and found
our families well, which I considered as an additional favour
from my heavenly Father, whose mercy is over all his works.</p>

<p>I was from home at this time about forty-nine days, and
attended forty-nine meetings, and travelled about four hundred
and fifty miles.</p>

<p class="chap-head">General visit to Friends of the yearly meeting of New-York, 1819.</p>


<p>I continued at and about home, until the commencement of
the year 1819, attending our meetings as they came in course.
I also attended two funerals, at which I had good service; and
the meeting at Westbury, on a first day, in which I was led to
open to Friends the three principal requisites to the being, and
well-being, of a Christian. The first being a real belief in <i>God</i>
and <i>Christ</i>, <i>as one undivided essence</i>, known and believed in,
<i>inwardly</i> and <i>spiritually</i>. The second, a complete passive
obedience and submission to the divine will and power inwardly
and spiritually manifested; which, when known, brings to the
Christian state, through a crucifixion of the old man, with all his
ungodly deeds. The third, in order for the preservation and well-being
of a Christian, it is necessary that they often meet and
assemble together, for the promotion of love and good works, and
as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. For this purpose
the Lord’s people and children have been led by his spirit to
appoint times and seasons in which to present themselves before
him. Of these times, all being apprized, and living within a
reasonable distance of the place so appointed, it becomes their
bounden duty to attend, in order to wait upon, and thereby
become qualified to worship God, in spirit and in truth; and no
temporal concern of the greatest magnitude ought be considered
as a sufficient excuse for omitting this great and necessary
duty. For the experience of many ages has shown, that those
who suffer their temporal business to divert them from a steady
attendance on their religious meetings, never make any real proficiency
in religion, or the true spiritual life. The communication<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356"></a>[Pg 356]</span>
was impressive, and reached the witness in many minds, and truth
was exalted, and the honest-hearted comforted, and I was made
glad in believing that my labour had not been in vain. Such
seasons are truly worthy of grateful remembrance.</p>

<p>As, on my return home, I did not feel myself released from a
further prosecution of my concern, and visit to Friends of our
yearly meeting, with the concurrence of my friends, I retained
the minute I had received for that purpose, and on the 2d of 1st
month, 1819, I again left home, and proceeded in the engagement.
My son-in-law Valentine Hicks joined me as companion
in the journey. We proceeded to New-York; and, the next day
being the first of the week, we attended Friends’ meeting at
Pearl-street in the morning. After this, in the afternoon, we proceeded
on our journey as far as our friend Thomas Walker’s, at
West Farms, near West Chester, where we had a meeting, at
the sixth hour in the evening. On second day, we had an
appointed meeting at Mamaroneck. These meetings were in a
good degree favoured, in which the presence and love of our
heavenly Father were felt to preside.</p>

<p>On third day we had another opportunity, by appointment, at
White Plains, in the court-house. It was rather a season of hard
labour, as the truths communicated did not appear to have free
course, in any general way; but, I trust, some were instructed
and edified. On fourth and fifth days, we attended Friends’
meetings at Purchase, and Shapaqua. As notice was given of
our intention to attend them, they were large; and through
divine condescension, they proved seasons of favour, in which the
truths of the gospel were largely declared in the demonstration of
the spirit, to the edification of the assemblies, and peace of my
own mind.</p>

<p>The two following days we attended meetings at Croton Valley,
and Amawalk. They were well attended by Friends, and
some others. I was led to open among them many essential doctrines
of the Christian religion; and to show to the people, in the
openings of truth, the way and means by which, and by which
only, our redemption and salvation can be effected. The testimonies
had a very reaching effect upon the auditories: many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357"></a>[Pg 357]</span>
present were much broken and contrited, and truth was raised
into victory, and a precious solemnity was spread over the meetings,
to the comfort and edification of the honest-hearted, which
was cause of thankfulness and gratitude to the beneficent Author
of all our mercies.</p>

<p>First day the 10th. We attended Friends’ meeting at Croton
in the morning, and at Peekskill in the evening. Both were full
meetings, in which the power of the gospel was felt to preside,
furnishing with wisdom and strength to divide the word, to the
several states present, in a way which seemed to give each his
due portion, and none sent empty away, but those who refused to
take their own part. Many hearts were broken and contrited,
and the honest-hearted comforted; and the Lord’s name and
power praised and exalted over all, who is worthy for ever.</p>

<p>On second day we rode to Nine Partners; and on third day
evening had an appointed meeting at Dover. It was held in a
pretty large school-house, there being no other place so convenient
in the neighbourhood; but it was too small to contain the people
who assembled, some being obliged to stand without, for want of
room. It was a very solemn, instructive meeting.</p>

<p>On fourth day we attended Pleasant Valley meeting; and
notice being given of our expectation to attend it, the meeting
was large. A considerable number of other societies were present
who behaved soberly, consistent with the occasion. It was a
season of great favour, under a sense of which the honest-hearted
were made to rejoice.</p>

<p>After this, we proceeded to Poughkeepsie, and attended an
appointed meeting in the evening, at the sixth hour. It was held
in their court-house, a large convenient room, but not sufficient
to contain the people who assembled; many were obliged to
withdraw for want of room. It proved, through the condescending
goodness of our heavenly Father, a blessed meeting to myself,
and, we had cause to believe, to the assembly in general. Thanks
be to God for his unspeakable gift: yet we have reason to believe
there were some present watching for evil, as carpers and opposers,
if we may judge from the conduct of the hireling priests,
since I was there a few weeks before, as I was informed at this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358"></a>[Pg 358]</span>
time, that they had joined together to calumniate me, an endeavour
to lay waste the testimony I then had to bear. We tarried
here most of the next day, visiting some of our friends.</p>

<p>On sixth day we proceeded to Hudson, where we arrived at
evening. The following evening, we had an appointed meeting
in the town of Claverack, about four miles distant from Hudson.
The inhabitants were mostly Dutch; a considerable number
attended, and behaved pretty soberly; and way opened to communicate
divers truths of the gospel, in a clear and impressive
manner among them, to which they paid good attention, and
appeared to be generally well satisfied. The next day, being
first day, we attended Friends’ meeting in Hudson, and an
appointed meeting in the evening. The latter was very large,
more than the house could contain. These were favoured meetings,
in which I was largely led forth in testimony to the truths
of the Christian religion, setting forth, in a clear manner, the
ground and source from whence all true religion and true worship
have their spring and origin. A general solemnity prevailed,
and truth was raised into dominion over all.</p>

<p>On second day, we proceeded to Kinderhook, and had a meeting
in the evening in a school-house, and on third day afternoon,
we had an appointed meeting in Spencertown. These were
both crowded meetings, mostly made up of the different societies
common among us; many of them were the descendants of
the old Dutch inhabitants, not much acquainted with our customs
and order; yet they generally behaved soberly, and
gave good attention to the testimonies borne. Many gospel
truths were opened to their consideration, and the Lord’s presence
and power were felt to crown these solemn assemblies; and I
parted from them in true peace and thankfulness of heart.</p>

<p>On fourth and fifth days, we attended Friends’ meetings at
Kline Kiln, and New Britain. In both of these meetings, I had
good service for truth and its blessed cause, and the hurtful tendency
of a dependance on forms, and outward ordinances and
ceremonies in religion and worship, was laid open and exposed.</p>

<p>On sixth day, we proceeded to Troy, where we rested on
seventh day, and wrote to our families. On first day, we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a>[Pg 359]</span>
attended Friends’ meetings at Troy, both forenoon and afternoon,
and, information being given that we were there, they were large.
At the forenoon meeting, more assembled than the house could
contain; and that gracious Being, who never leaves nor forsakes
his dependant children, whose trust is fixed on him, was near for
our help; and opened my heart and mouth in both meetings, to
declare largely of the things concerning the kingdom of God, and
to open many gospel truths to the people, and to show the fallacy
and hurtful tendency of all ceremonial religion, which consists in
the observance of days and times, and outward ordinances. The
people were generally attentive; and I found solid peace in my
labours of love among them.</p>

<p>On second day, we proceeded to Pittstown, and the next day
had a meeting appointed there, at the eleventh hour, which was a
large, favoured meeting. After this we proceeded to White
Creek, and attended <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Friend’s">Friends’</span> meeting as it came in course the
next day; and, information being given that we were there, it
was largely attended. The Lord’s presence was felt to preside,
and truth was raised into victory. Oh my soul! what wilt thou,
or canst thou render unto the Lord, for all his benefits; “for his
mercies are new every morning, and great is his faithfulness.”</p>

<p>On fifth day we attended an appointed meeting in the town of
Shaftsbury, on our way to Danby. In this place, none of our
society reside, except one female member, the wife of a well-disposed
man, at whose house we put up, and were very hospitably
entertained. The meeting, although small, was attended by the
governor of the state, and divers of the judges and magistrates.
It was a season of favour; many essential doctrines of the Christian
religion were opened to them, in the demonstration of truth,
and I parted with them in thankfulness of heart, and with a
peaceful mind; and the next day rode to Danby.</p>

<p>On seventh day, we attended an appointed meeting near a village
called the Borough, in the east part of the town; and on first
day, attended Friends’ meeting on the Hill. Both were fully
attended by Friends, and the neighbouring inhabitants; and were
both solemn instructive seasons, in which the power of truth
was felt to preside, enabling to preach the gospel in the demon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"></a>[Pg 360]</span>stration
of the spirit, to the comfort and encouragement of the
living, faithful few, and to the instruction and edification of the
honest inquirers, whose faces were turned Zion-ward; likewise
spreading caution and reproof to the indolent and careless.</p>

<p>On second day we proceeded towards <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Ferrisburg">Ferrisburgh</span>, where we
arrived on third day afternoon, and the next day attended the
monthly meeting at that place. The four following days, we
attended meetings in the following order: On fifth day we had
an appointed meeting at Monkton. It was large, and proved a
very solemn, favoured meeting, in which the power of truth prevailed,
silencing all opposition, and ran as oil, to the comfort,
encouragement and instruction of the honest-hearted. Bless the
Lord, O my soul, and forget not any of his benefits! On sixth
day we attended Friends’ monthly meeting at Starksborough.
On seventh day had an appointed meeting in a school-house, in
the southeast part of the town, where Friends hold a small meeting;
and on first day was at Friends’ meeting at Lincoln. These
were all favoured meetings, in which I had good service for truth
and its cause.</p>

<p>On second day, we returned into the south part of Monkton,
and had an evening meeting in a kinsman’s house, by the name
of Stephen Haight. He was convinced of the principles of
Friends, but failed in the practical part. This proved a pretty
exercising season, by reason of the unsettled state of some who
attended; especially in the silent part of the meeting: for being
brought up and educated in the belief that, unless they are
engaged in some bodily exercise, such as outward and vocal singing,
praying, preaching, and the like, there is no meeting; being
so instructed by their teachers, it is very difficult to get them
into stillness, or into any right condition to hear. This makes
hard work for the true gospel minister, whose labour and
travail is to get into, and bring others into, a state of true solemn
silence; that he may therefore become baptized into the state of
the people, and be qualified to administer to their real conditions;
for otherwise preaching is vain. But as I continued patient in
travail, my mouth was opened in a large searching testimony,
showing the fallacy and emptiness of all outward ceremonial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361"></a>[Pg 361]</span>
worship; and that it must inevitably land all those who trust
therein, in a state of sad disappointment, in the end. I was led
also to open, in a clear manner to the people, the most essential
doctrines of the Christian religion, to the information and satisfaction
of the honest inquiring minds.</p>

<p>The next day we returned to Ferrisburgh, in order to attend
the quarterly meeting which opened on fourth day, with the meeting
of Ministers and Elders, which I attended, and had good service
among them. I was led to open in the life the order of
true gospel ministry, and the necessity all are under, who are
called to that solemn and important office, of keeping their vessels
clean, not only from sin and every pollution of flesh and spirit,
but also in their ministry from all the dregs or remains of former
offerings. For if, through the strength of memory, any act upon
former offerings, such communications tend to produce death,
rather than life. We find, under the law, that the vessels in the
Lord’s house were not only at first made pure and holy, but when
they were made use of in the Lord’s offerings, and had been filled
with the Lord’s holy things, when that season of offering was
over, they were then cleansed from all the remains and dregs of
such offering, and put up in their places clean and empty. This
also agrees with the doctrine of Christ to his apostles: “Every
branch in me,” he says, “that beareth fruit, my heavenly Father
purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.” It was, I trust,
an instructive season, there being a number present who were
young in the ministry.</p>

<p>After this meeting we rode to Vergennes, and attended an
appointed meeting at six in the evening. It was pretty well
attended by the inhabitants of the town, who generally behaved
soberly. I was led to open divers important doctrines of the gospel
for their consideration, and to caution them against having
any fellowship with, or affording any support to the dark, and
what I esteem, pernicious system of Free Masonry. They were
generally attentive, and withdrew quietly.</p>

<p>The two following days, we attended the quarterly meeting
for discipline; and the parting meeting for worship. These, I
trust, were profitable opportunities. The latter was a highly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>[Pg 362]</span>
favoured meeting, in which truth reigned over all; and I took
leave of my friends in the sensible feeling of true gospel fellowship.</p>

<p>We rode, that afternoon and evening, to Shoram, and lodged
with our kind friends Zebulon and Elizabeth Frost. The next
day at evening, had an appointed meeting there, which many of
the neighbouring inhabitants attended. It was a solemn time,
in which many doctrines of the Christian religion were opened
for their instruction and consideration; and I parted with them
with a peaceful mind.</p>

<p>The next day we rode to Granville; and the following day
had an appointed meeting there, at one o’clock in the afternoon.
This was a greatly favoured opportunity, the power of truth
breaking down and dispelling every opposite spirit, humbling
and contriting many hearts, and comforting and strengthening
the honest-hearted. Surely it was the Lord’s doing; a sense
of which inspires gratitude and thankfulness of heart, for the
unmerited favour.</p>

<p>On third day we rode to Easton. On fourth and fifth days
we attended their quarterly meeting for discipline, and public
meeting for worship. Their meeting of Ministers and Elders
was held on third day previous to our arrival. On sixth day we
had an appointed meeting at Cambridge. These meetings were
all comfortable instructive seasons, in which the doctrines of truth
were largely opened, for the information and edification of the
people.</p>

<p>We rested on seventh day, feeling myself pretty much worn
out with such continual and almost incessant labour in travelling
and in meetings. On first day I again attended Easton meeting
which was also a large favoured meeting, in which the power of
truth was exalted.</p>

<p>On second day we proceeded on our way to Queensbury, and
attended a meeting in our way, which I had previously appointed
at a large village called Whipple City. It was largely attended
by the neighbouring inhabitants. There were no members of
our society in the place. It was, I think, a favoured opportunity,
in which I was enabled to declare the truth among them, in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363"></a>[Pg 363]</span>
large, effective testimony. Many present were humbled and contrited,
and I parted with them in true peace of mind.</p>

<p>After this we proceeded to Queensbury, where we arrived in
the evening. The three following days we attended the quarterly
meeting held there at this time for Saratoga and Queensbury. I
also attended two evening meetings in two neighbouring villages,
which I had appointed for the benefit of those of other societies,
who pretty generally attended. I think the quarterly meeting
in general was an instructive favoured time. The two other
meetings were exercising seasons; the minds of the people
appeared to be very much veiled, and in a state of much ignorance;
being generally too much swallowed up in worldly pursuits,
and self-gratifications. This makes hard work for the
devoted traveller, who is engaged for the advancement of the
cause of truth and righteousness in the earth. But as I waited,
and patiently endured the baptisms necessary to be brought into
a feeling of their real conditions, way opened to communicate
doctrine suitable for their instruction and help; and, although
there did not appear much effect wrought for the present, yet I
had reason to hope, that the labour would not be all lost; nor
the word return void, but would, in the end, accomplish the thing
whereunto it was sent, and be as bread cast upon the waters to
return after many days. My hope in this respect was strengthened
from the satisfaction and true peace I felt in the ardent
labour I passed through, in these seasons of exercise.</p>

<p>The quarterly meeting being over, we proceeded to Saratoga,
and on sixth day had an appointed meeting there at two o’clock
in the afternoon. This was a large favoured meeting, in which
truth was raised into victory over all, and under its precious influence
the gospel was preached in the clear demonstration of the
spirit. Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift.</p>

<p>From thence we proceeded to Milton, and on first day, the
28th of 2d month, we attended Friends’ meeting there. It was
largely attended by Friends and others, and through the condescending
goodness of Israel’s unslumbering Shepherd it proved
an instructive edifying season.</p>

<p>The five following days, we attended meetings at Greenfield,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364"></a>[Pg 364]</span>
Galloway, Providence, Mayfield, and Northampton. Although
things in most places, as it regards the life of religion, appeared
rather low, and considerable rawness was apparent in many in
that respect, yet such is the unmerited kindness of the heavenly
Father, that he graciously condescended to break the bread, and
caused it to be distributed to the people, in these several opportunities,
so that none were sent empty away, except those who
either neglected or refused to take the portion allotted them; and
my spirit was comforted, under an evident sense that I had faithfully
discharged my duty among them.</p>

<p>From Northampton we proceeded to Newtown, and on first
day the 7th of 3d month, we attended Friends’ meeting at that
place; and, information being given that we were there, it was
large. A very considerable number more assembled, than the
house could contain, who were obliged to stand without. For
these I felt much sympathy and concern, as the weather was very
cold, and those without, not willing to lose the opportunity, continued
until the meeting ended, which held nearly three hours.
But I had cause to hope they did not go away unrewarded, as
the season proved a very favoured one, in which the divine
presence was felt to preside, enabling to preach the gospel of the
grace of God to the people, in the demonstration of truth, and to
the comfort and peace of my own mind.</p>

<p>On the evenings of the two following days, I attended meetings
by appointment, at Waterford and Troy. Both were largely
attended by those not in membership with us. On fourth day,
attended Friends’ monthly meeting at Troy. On fifth day evening,
had a very large meeting in Albany, which was held in
the state-house, a large, commodious room for the purpose. In
these several meetings truth was felt to arise into dominion, and
ability afforded to discharge myself faithfully in communication
to the people who assembled, I trust, to their general satisfaction
and edification; may it instructively fasten on their minds, as a
nail in a sure place, driven by the Master of assemblies, that so
the word preached may tend to real profit, and not return void,
but accomplish the end to which it was sent.</p>

<p>From thence we proceeded to Bern, within the compass of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>[Pg 365]</span>
Duanesburgh quarterly meeting, where we arrived on sixth day
evening, and lodged with our kind friend Samuel Cary, who,
with his affectionate wife and children, treated us with great hospitality.
The next evening we had an appointed meeting at a
village about four miles distant, where no member of our society
resides. We intended to return and attend Friends’ meeting at
Bern, on first day; but a snow storm coming on seventh day,
and increasing towards evening and all next day with such
violence, that, although we got to the evening meeting, which
was small, by reason of the storm, we were not able to return
until the following second day, and then it was with great
difficulty that we got along, the snow was so deep, and the
roads drifted full. We however made the attempt to return
on first day morning, and got on our way about half a mile,
but could proceed no farther. We then called at a house
on the way, a good looking mansion belonging to a professor
among the Presbyterians. Here we tarried over first day, not
being able to proceed. We held a little meeting there with this
family, and three of their friends, who were with them on a visit,
in which my mind was opened to communicate to them the
grounds of our profession, and the doctrines of the Christian religion,
as held by us. This had a very considerable effect on the
man’s wife, so that she openly acknowledged to the truths, delivered,
and assured all present that she should vindicate them, as
certain undeniable truths, which she felt to be so, in her own
experience.</p>

<p>On the following fifth day, we attended Friends’ meeting at
Bern. The weather being again stormy and inclement, it was
small. The roads were blocked up, so as to prevent many from
attending. The next day we proceeded to Duanesburgh, and
had a meeting there on seventh day, which was a large favoured
season. On first day we attended meetings at Charlestown in the
morning, and at Carlisle in the evening. On second day we
proceeded to Middleburgh, and the next day had a meeting there.
The day following, had meetings at Oakhill in the morning, and
at Rensselaerville in the afternoon. After this we returned with
our friend Samuel Cary to his house, who had kindly accompa<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366"></a>[Pg 366]</span>nied
us in this little tour. I felt true peace of mind, from a consciousness
that I had faithfully discharged myself in the service
allotted me, in those several meetings, void of any influence from
the fear or favour of man.</p>

<p>On fifth day, we attended Friends’ monthly meeting at Bern.
The meeting for worship was attended by a very considerable
number of the neighbouring inhabitants, not in membership with
us, who behaved themselves soberly, and were very attentive to
what was communicated. Many were broken and contrited by
the prevalence of truth, which was raised into dominion in this
favoured meeting. Not only the meeting for worship, but likewise
that for discipline was a comfortable instructive season.</p>

<p>The two following days, we had meetings at New Baltimore,
and a village where several families of Friends reside, by the name
of Dickenson, from whom they call the meeting “Dickenson’s
meeting;” and at Coeman’s, alias, Stanton Hill. I had good service
in those several meetings, in which Friends appeared to be
brought near together, in the feeling influence of the truth, and
in the oneness of the spirit. In a sense of this, we had gratefully
to acknowledge that the Lord is still mindful of his people, fulfilling
all his promises to those who seek him with sincerity of
heart; and they that seek him early will find him to be near at
hand, a present helper in every needful time.</p>

<p>After the latter meeting, we proceeded to Athens; and, the
next day being the first of the week, and the 28th of 3d month,
we attended Friends’ meeting there in the morning, and had
another meeting by appointment in the afternoon. These were
exercising meetings, particularly so in the forepart of the latter.
A great power of darkness seemed so to prevail, as entirely for a
considerable time, to close up the way to any public service; but
as I patiently submitted to the baptism and willingly became baptized,
with and for the dead, for it is only through death, that the
resurrection from death can be witnessed, a little glimmering of
light appeared, in which I felt the necessity of standing up;
and as I proceeded, keeping my eye single to the light that led
the way, the light more and more arose, and the darkness vanished;
and He that opens and none can shut, and shuts and none<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>[Pg 367]</span>
but himself can open, made way for the promotion of his own
righteous cause, and the exaltation of truth’s testimonies. It was
the Lord’s doing, and marvellous in mine eyes.</p>

<p>We left here on second day morning, and proceeded to Alexander
Young’s at the east part of Esopus, about forty miles.
This was a day of very hard travel, both for man and horse, the
roads being bad, as the winter was just breaking up; but we
arrived safe in the evening, and were kindly received by our
friends, which made up in part for the toil of the day.</p>

<p>At this place we had an appointed meeting the next day. The
five following days we had meetings at Rosendale Plains, Paltz,
Plattekill, Newburgh Valley and Marlborough. Attending these
meetings, with the exercise of travelling on the heavy, rough roads,
produced a large portion of exercise, both to body and mind. But
the Lord’s strengthening and consoling presence, vouchsafed from
season to season for our help, carried us through and over all, to the
praise of his grace, and to the comfort and peace of our own minds.</p>

<p>On second day, the 5th of 4th month, we proceeded to Cornwall,
and attended a meeting by previous appointment, at the
eleventh hour. The next day, had an appointed meeting at
Smith’s Clove, and the day following were at a place called the
Upper Clove, alias Blooming Grove. In these several meetings
I was led largely to open to the people the law state, or dispensation
of figure, as comprehensively set forth in the Old Testament,
and to show the difference between that and the gospel, and that
the first ends where the latter begins, and are as distinct from
each other, as the body is from the soul. The first comprehends
the salvation of bodies from outward servitude, the latter the salvation
of the soul from sin, and the death consequent on it. I
also set forth the use and necessity of the rituals, or shadows of
that dispensation, during its continuance; and that they were
all abolished under the gospel, and have no part nor lot under
that dispensation. I had much service in these meetings, and
great cause of gratitude and thankfulness to the bountiful Author
of all our multiplied favours.</p>

<p>The next day, we attended Friends’ meeting at Kakiat, alias
Hempstead. We had a tedious time in getting there, the road,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368"></a>[Pg 368]</span>
part of the way, being deep with mud and wet, and much cut up.
But the Lord richly rewarded us for all our toil, in giving us a
precious meeting with our friends, and a considerable number of
the neighbouring inhabitants. It was truly a season of grateful
remembrance, both by us and our friends; we were made to
rejoice together for the unmerited favour.</p>

<p>After this we proceeded to Tappan, to the house of our friend
John Lawrence. Here is not any meeting of Friends; but feeling
the way open, we appointed a meeting there at two o’clock
next day. Although it was not large, yet, I trust, it was a comfortable
instructive season to some present.</p>

<p>This meeting closed our visit, and the next morning we proceeded
to New-York, where we heard of the decease of my kinsman
Benjamin Hicks, with information that he was to be interred
the next day.</p>

<p>This induced us to proceed home that afternoon, where we
arrived between eight and nine at night, much wearied, having
travelled in the course of the day upwards of fifty miles, and
some of the way but indifferent travelling. Finding, however,
our dear families well, accompanied with sweet peace of mind,
it made rich amends for all our toil, and my heart was inspired
with gratitude and thankfulness to the great and gracious Author
of all our blessings.</p>

<p>I was from home in this journey fourteen weeks, attended
seventy-three meetings, three quarterly meetings, four monthly
meetings, and travelled one thousand and eighty-four miles.</p>

<p>The next day I attended the funeral of the aforesaid Friend,
which was on first day the 11th of 4th month, 1819. It was
largely attended by Friends and others, he being a man much
esteemed by his friends and neighbours, and a useful member of
society, both in a religious and moral relation, and his memory
will be blessed. It was a very solemn time, in which my heart
and mouth were largely opened to declare to the people of the
things concerning the kingdom of God; and to point out to them
in a full and clear manner, the only way and means by which
an entrance therein is attainable by the children of men. It was
a season of favour, and many hearts were made to rejoice under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369"></a>[Pg 369]</span>
an humbling sense of the gracious extending of heavenly regard
to the workmanship of His holy hand.</p>

<p>After this my lot seemed similar to Mordecai’s of old, when
sitting at the king’s gate; I had but little public service when at
and about home. This brought to my remembrance, the saying
of our Lord to his disciples, on their return from the service <span class="correction" title="In the original book: he he">he</span>
had sent them out to perform in the land of Israel. When
they had given him an account how well they had succeeded, he
invited them to retire awhile and rest. I was mostly silent in
our meetings at home, and was not from home, except to attend
a funeral in a neighbouring town, and our quarterly meeting at
New-York, until our yearly meeting.</p>

<p>This opened on seventh day, the 22d of 5th month, with a
meeting of Ministers and Elders. The yearly meeting for discipline
opened on the following second day, and closed near evening,
on the fifth day following. It was, I think, in general, a
favoured meeting, although the weaknesses and deficiencies still
among us, as manifested by the accounts from our quarterly
meetings, were cause of exercise and travail to the honest-hearted
who are engaged for the promotion of the cause of righteousness
and peace in the earth; yet the condescending goodness of the
Shepherd of Israel, in manifesting his life-giving presence for our
encouragement and support, inspired the hearts of the living with
thanksgiving and gratitude for his unmerited mercies. We
returned home the next day.</p>

<p>I now found it my duty to pay some attention to my temporal
concerns, and to see that all accounts between myself and others
were truly adjusted and settled, as is my general rule from year
to year. A rule which every honest man will be led to pursue,
to prevent trouble and preserve harmony; as a contrary course
often leads to vexation and litigation, by which both parties are
often hurt and wounded.</p>

<p>First day the 30th of 5th month. I attended our meeting as
usual, when at home. Had a short communication, tending to
excite Friends to faithfulness, and an inward labour, that the
true end of our meeting together might be answered. I was
busily employed in the course of this week, in my temporal con<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370"></a>[Pg 370]</span>cerns.
Attended our fifth day meeting; and closed the week
in quiet.</p>

<p>First day, the 6th of 6th month. I was led, in our meeting,
to show Friends the fallacy of trusting in the outside appearance
of things, without coming to possess the real substance, as the
day is hastening when every foundation will be tried, and all
will receive according as their works have been. I was considerably
enlarged, and the power of truth was exalted over all.</p>

<p>I found it my place at this time, to keep close at home, both
in an inward and outward sense, to arrange my temporal concerns,
and set things in order; not knowing how soon I may
be called to leave them all, and surrender them, with myself, to
the guardian care and disposal of a gracious Providence, who
doth not suffer a sparrow to fall to the ground, without his heavenly
notice. I attended our preparative meeting on fifth day,
and the meeting of the Charity Society, for educating the children
of the poor black people, on seventh day; in both of which
I felt satisfaction and peace of mind.</p>

<p>First day, the 13th of 6th month. Towards the close of our
meeting to-day, I had to open to Friends the necessity of our
individually coming to know what life we are living; whether
it be a life after the flesh, which worketh death to the immortal
soul; or a life of the spirit, by which we become spiritually-minded.
For if we live after the flesh, it will prove in the world
to come an eternal death to the soul; but if it be a life in the
spirit, and in the things of heaven, it will prove an everlasting
life to the soul, in the world to come; and will crown it with joy
unspeakable, and full of glory, at God’s right hand for evermore.</p>

<p>From this time to our monthly meeting in 7th month, I was
pretty steadily at home. Attended our meetings as they came
in course; and was very busily and necessarily engaged in my
temporal concerns, having a prospect before me of attending
the ensuing yearly meeting of Ohio, and also some other
meetings in that, and in the compass of Baltimore and Philadelphia
yearly meeting. This concern I spread before my
Friends, at our monthly meeting the 15th of 7th month; and
obtained their unity and concurrence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371"></a>[Pg 371]</span></p>

<p>First day, the 18th of 7th month. Attended our meeting.
We had the company of our ancient honest friend Thomas
Titus. He communicated for our consideration, some plain
truths, in order to stir up and encourage Friends to industry and
faithfulness in those things which belong to their everlasting
peace and welfare. I felt unity with him in his exercise, and
found it my place and duty to make some addition, to bring the
matter close home to the minds of Friends. It was a favoured
solemn meeting, and most minds seemed well affected with the
heavenly power which was felt to preside.</p>

<p>In the course of this week our quarterly meeting was held at
Westbury. It was well attended by Friends; and the public
meeting was very large. It was in the main a favoured meeting.
I likewise opened to this meeting, my prospect of attending
the yearly meeting of Ohio; and produced the minute of unity
and concurrence from our monthly meeting. It was fully united
with by the quarterly meeting, and an endorsement thereof made
on my certificate.</p>

<p>First day the 25th. A silent meeting to-day. When such
meetings are attended with full acquiescence, and entire peace of
mind, how precious they are. Thus are the Lord’s dedicated
children led and instructed; taught how to suffer want, and how
to abound; being content in every dispensation of his divine
will and pleasure: and in this condition, all things work together
for good to these. Hence we are led to “Rejoice evermore.
Pray without ceasing. In every thing give thanks.”</p>

<p>The rest of this week I was diligently employed in preparing
for my intended journey; and in arranging my temporal concerns,
that no occasion might be given to the adversaries of truth,
to reproach the truth, or its cause, by any neglect or omission on
my part; and endeavouring that all things might be left sweet
and quiet at home, that so I might leave it with peace of mind,
freed from every burden and care on that account; and be fully
at liberty to devote myself wholly to the service of my great
and good Master, until the allotted portion is accomplished,
which he hath called me forth to fulfil. For to him belong<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372"></a>[Pg 372]</span>
obedience and worship, who is over all, God blessed for ever.
Amen.</p>

<p>First day the 1st of 8th month. At our meeting to-day, my
mind was led into a view of the excellence and necessity of a
right faith in God and Christ; it being that by which the just
live. For nothing else can qualify to live a life of true righteousness
and justice, but a true and living faith in God and Christ;
and without this faith, it is impossible to please God. The subject
spread and led to communication in a large testimony, by which
many minds were reached and comforted, and a precious solemnity
spread over the meeting; and we parted from each other
with grateful hearts for the unmerited favour.</p>

<p>On fifth day I was led to call the attention of my friends to
first principles, and to recur to the uprightness, simplicity, and
faithfulness of our worthy predecessors, and to recount the great
and sorrowful deviations therefrom by those who are making
the same profession in the present day, in departing from a full
reliance and dependance on the power and spirit that actuated
and governed them. Hence weakness and darkness pervade
their minds, by which great reproach is brought upon the society,
and occasion given for many to speak evil of the truth, and the
principle we hold out to the world, as the only sure guide to
blessedness; to the wounding of the faithful few, who are yet preserved
in a good degree of gospel simplicity, and who live under
a daily exercise for the promotion and advancement of the Messiah’s
kingdom here on earth, and that it may arise and become
the peace and glory of all nations.</p>

<p>Having, as before noted, had it on my mind to attend the
next yearly meeting of Friends in the state of Ohio, and some
other meetings in going there and returning home; and having
obtained a minute of unity and concurrence from our monthly
and quarterly meeting, I left home in order to accomplish the
service, the 17th of 8th month, 1819, and proceeded to New-York.
The next day, being first day, I attended Friends’ meeting in
Pearl-street in the morning, which proved a favoured season, in
which I witnessed a renewal of strength, and a satisfactory evidence
that my <span class="correction" title="In the original book: proceedure">procedure</span> was under right direction; for which
my mind was reduced into a state of humble gratitude for the
unmerited mercy; having left my home in weakness and poverty
of spirit, and nothing to lean on in crossing this Jordan, but
my slender staff of faith. I attended the meeting at Liberty-street
in the afternoon, which, although small, was in a good
degree comfortable, and encouraging to my much exercised mind.
As our meeting for sufferings was the succeeding third day, I
staid in town and attended that meeting.</p>

<p>After this I proceeded on my journey, accompanied by my
kind friend and neighbour Willet Robbins, who had joined me
as a companion in this journey. We attended the quarterly
meeting at Rahway on our way, which opened the next day with
the meeting of Ministers and Elders. The meeting for discipline
was held the day after; and a meeting for public worship, as a
parting meeting, the succeeding day. In these several opportu<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374"></a>[Pg 374]</span>nities,
way opened to discharge myself faithfully in the exercise
of gospel communication to my friends and others who attended,
fully to the relief of my own mind, and, I trust, to the instruction
and encouragement of many who attended; the Lord having
been graciously pleased to manifest his presence and power
for our help, to the glory and praise of his own excellent name,
who is over all, God blessed for ever.</p>

<p>After these solemn opportunities were closed, we took leave of
our friends, and proceeded on our journey; and arrived at
Easton on seventh day evening. This is a town on the
west side of the river Delaware, in the state of Pennsylvania.
Having felt my mind led to pass through this town, attended
with a concern to have a religious opportunity with the inhabitants,
we tarried with them the next day, and had a
meeting appointed, which was held in their school-house, at
the fourth hour in the afternoon. It proved, through heavenly
help, a favoured, and, I trust, an instructive season to many;
several of their ministers and most of the principal people attended,
and appeared all to go away satisfied; and many apparently
with thankful hearts for the present favour; and I parted with
them in true peace of mind.</p>

<p>The next morning we proceeded on our journey, and rode to
Maiden Creek, and lodged with our kind friend Isaac Penrose.
The day following being third day, we had an appointed meeting
at Reading, about eight miles farther on our way. It was
held in their court-house. Many of the inhabitants of the town
attended, and behaved soberly; and the gospel was preached
among them in the plain demonstration of truth, and, I trust,
was as a sword or hammer to some present, who were not prepared
to meet sound doctrine; but was comfortable and instructive
to others, such as were tender in spirit, and were honestly
seeking the way to peace. It was a solemn, and, I trust, profitable
opportunity.</p>

<p>After the meeting I made a short visit to a sick woman, who
appeared to be drawing fast toward her close. She was comforted
in the visit, and when I parted with her, appeared in a
quiet resigned state of mind. Her bodily affliction, which had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375"></a>[Pg 375]</span>
attended her for a considerable time, had, I believe, wrought a
good work in her. After this opportunity we proceeded immediately
on our journey, which we continued the four following
days, through a number of towns and villages, where no Friends
live.</p>

<p>We arrived on seventh day evening at Dunning’s Creek,
where there is a monthly meeting of Friends. They lie very
much detached from the body of society; the nearest meeting
to them is about sixty miles distant. We attended their meeting
on first day, which proved, through heavenly help, a comfortable,
strengthening opportunity. We lodged with our kind
friend Thomas Penrose.</p>

<p>The next morning we proceeded on our journey, having the
Alleghany, and several other mountains and high and rough ridges
of land to pass over, in our way to the settlements of Friends
in the Redstone country. The roads were excessively bad, and
in some places almost impassable; but with two days hard travelling
we got safe to Connelsville, on the west side of the mountains,
on third day evening. We put up with a man by the
name of John Gibson, who had once a right of membership in
our society, but by some means had lost it; yet he appeared to
retain his love to Friends, and was very kind and benevolent,
and appeared very glad of the opportunity of entertaining Friends.
His family likewise appeared very kind and friendly, and signified
it as a matter of considerable regret, that they were so far
distant from Friends, as not to have the privilege of attending
their meetings. There was one family of Friends in the town;
and one of their children, an infant of about eight months old,
had died a little before our arrival; and the funeral being the
next day, we attended it. It was a very solemn opportunity, in
which many hearts were contrited by the tendering power of
truth, which was felt to cover the assembly in a very general
manner. Such seasons are as a brook by the way, to the poor
exercised travellers, who often go mourning on their way, from
a sense of the prevalence of sin and iniquity in the land.</p>

<p>After this solemn opportunity we proceeded on our journey,
and the next day attended Friends’ monthly meeting at West<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376"></a>[Pg 376]</span>land,
in Redstone quarterly meeting. I had some service, both
in the meeting for worship, and that for discipline; but things
appeared rather low as to the right order of the gospel, in both
meetings. It being a day of ease and outward tranquillity; and
this hath a tendency to produce lukewarmness, if not watchfully
and diligently guarded against.</p>

<p>From this place we proceeded directly to Mount Pleasant, in
Ohio, where the yearly meeting is held; where we arrived on
seventh day, the 28th of 8th month. On first day, the 29th,
attended Friends’ meeting at Short Creek in the morning, and
had an appointed meeting at Mount Pleasant in the afternoon.
They were both largely attended, and proved very instructive
satisfactory meetings, in which I had good service; and found
sweet peace as the result of my labours of love amongst them.</p>

<p>The five following days, meetings were appointed for us at
Concord, St. <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Clairville">Clairsville</span>, Plainfield, Flushing, and Harrisville.
These were all full meetings; generally more collected than the
houses could contain; but Friends were industrious, and provided
seats out of doors, about the house, by which the people were
generally accommodated.</p>

<p>On seventh day the yearly meeting of Ministers and Elders
opened; and continued by adjournments until fifth day. I
think they were generally favoured opportunities. The Head
of the Church graciously condescending to manifest his presence
for the help of his devoted, dedicated children; and this is the
crown and diadem of all our religious assemblies. On first day
public meetings for worship were held, both forenoon and afternoon,
in both Friends’ meeting-houses in the neighbourhood;
that in the town of Mount Pleasant, held in their new meeting-house,
which is one of the largest I ever saw belonging to
Friends, was very large. I attended that meeting both forenoon
and afternoon, in which I had much service by way of testimony;
which appeared to be much to the comfort and general
edification of the assemblies, and resulted in the solid peace of
my own mind.</p>

<p>On second day, the yearly meeting for discipline opened, and
continued by adjournments until seventh day toward evening.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377"></a>[Pg 377]</span>
It was a season of much travail and exercise to the rightly concerned
active members; having before them, in addition to their
usual business, the revisal of their discipline. I was led under
close exercise on the account, and a very considerable portion of
active service fell to my lot, with other Friends. It was thought,
I believe, by Friends generally, to have been the most favoured
yearly meeting they had had since its institution, and was
worthy of grateful remembrance.</p>

<p>I tarried here over first day, and attended their meeting at the
old meeting-house. It was a season of deep travail in the forepart
of the meeting, in which my spirit was led into deep baptism
with, and for, the dead; and I was brought into sympathy and
fellowship with the suffering seed, which appeared to me to be
pressed down in the hearts of the formal professors, as a cart
under sheaves. This, I believed, was too much the situation of
a considerable number in that assembly; but as I continued
patiently to endure the exercise, and kept up the inward travail,
light sprang up and dispelled the darkness, accompanied with a
motion of life to stand up; and my mouth was opened in a
large searching and effective testimony, whereby the dead were
raised, the lukewarm stirred up, the honest seekers encouraged,
and the rightly exercised minds comforted and edified. It was
the Lord’s doing, and marvellous in mine eyes.</p>

<p>The six succeeding days, meetings were appointed at the
following places, which we attended. On second day, at a
little village called York, where a few Friends were privileged
with an indulged meeting; a meeting not being established.
On third day at Smithfield; on fourth day at Cross Creek; on
fifth day at Franklin, where was also only a small indulged
meeting. On sixth day, at Augusta, at the tenth hour in the
morning, and at Sandy Spring, at the third hour in the afternoon;
on seventh day at New Garden. These were all seasons
of favour, wherein I was strengthened to labour in the work
of the gospel, and to declare largely to these several assemblies,
of the things concerning the kingdom of God; endeavouring,
by persuasive arguments, founded in the clear demonstration
of the spirit, accompanied with a lively evidence of divine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378"></a>[Pg 378]</span>
power to gather the minds of the people to the <i>light of Christ</i>,
or <i>Christ the light, in their own hearts; as the only sure
guide to blessedness</i>, and <i>foundation rock on which to build
all our hopes of redemption and salvation</i>. A precious solemnity
was felt to prevail in those several meetings, most of
which were crowded gatherings, many more often collecting
than their meeting-houses could contain; and truth was exalted
over all, to the praise of Him who is over all, God blessed for ever.</p>

<p>After the latter meeting we proceeded to Salem, intending to
be at Friends’ meeting there the next day, which was first day,
the 19th of 9th month. We attended the meeting in the forenoon,
but not feeling myself clear, I was led to appoint an afternoon
meeting; which was accordingly held at the third hour,
and was largely attended by Friends and others; among whom
way opened fully to discharge and clear myself, and I found
peace in my labour of love among them.</p>

<p>On second and third days, I attended meetings by appointment
at Springfield and Goshen, two neighbouring villages.
These were likewise very solemn instructive seasons, wherein I
was largely led forth in ministerial labour, apparently to the
comfort and edification of most present. From Goshen we
returned back to Salem, intending to be at their monthly meeting
to be held the next day, which we accordingly attended. I
had good service among my Friends, both in the meeting for
worship and that for discipline.</p>

<p>After this we took a final leave of them, in the fresh feelings
of mutual love and Christian fellowship, and proceeded on our
journey that afternoon to Fairfield, where we had a meeting
the next day. On sixth day, was at Columbiana. On seventh
day, at Middleton. And on first day, the 26th, had two meetings;
one in the morning at Elk Run, and the other at the
third hour in the afternoon at Carmel. These meetings were
all well attended; wherein I was led forth largely in testimony,
apparently to the general satisfaction and edification of the people,
and to the comfort and peace of my own mind.</p>

<p>On second day we proceeded to New Lisbon, and attended a
meeting in their court-house at the eleventh hour. It was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379"></a>[Pg 379]</span>
large collection, mostly made up of other societies, there being
but few Friends residing in that place. I was led to open several
doctrinal points of our profession, and to show the great
difference between profession and possession; and that no profession
of religion was worth esteeming as any thing, unless it
was the effect of the real possession of the thing professed; as
no profession of a thing, could of itself give any a possession
thereof; but a real possession, will manifest itself by its fruits.
It was a day of great favour, in which truth reigned over all.</p>

<p>On third day, we proceeded to Beaver Falls. Had a meeting
there the next day to good satisfaction. After this we travelled
on our way to Pittsburg, where we arrived the next day about
noon, and had an appointed meeting there in the evening in
their court-house. It was a large spacious building, but more
collected than the house could contain. I had much service
among them, and the Lord’s power was felt to preside, quieting
and solemnizing the assembly; and many hearts were humbled
and contrited, and truth raised into dominion over all.</p>

<p>On sixth day afternoon, we left Pittsburg on our way to
Brownsville, where we arrived in the afternoon of the next day.
On first day we attended Friends’ meeting there; and notice
being spread among the people at large that we were there, it
was a very crowded assembly, more than the house could well
contain. Through the condescending goodness of the Shepherd
of Israel, I was helped to discharge myself faithfully among
them, in an effective testimony to the truths of the gospel;
proving from clear scripture testimony, accompanied with the
demonstration of the spirit, in harmony with right reason, that
nothing short of a full belief in, and obedience to, the revelation
of the spirit of truth, (a manifestation of which is given to every
man and woman to profit withal,) as the only rule of faith and
practice, can make a real Christian, and produce redemption
and salvation to an immortal soul. It was a very solemn
instructive season, worthy of grateful remembrance.</p>

<p>On second day we had an appointed meeting at Sandy Hill,
at the tenth hour; and another in the evening at Uniontown,
held in their court-house. These were both seasons of favour,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380"></a>[Pg 380]</span>
producing solid peace to my own mind, and, I trust, instructive
and edifying to the people in general who attended. These
meetings closed my labours among Friends and others, in the
compass of the yearly meeting of Ohio.</p>

<p>On third day we set out on our journey over the mountains,
towards Winchester in Virginia; in order to attend the meetings
of Friends in that neighbourhood, on our way to Baltimore.
The distance was about one hundred and sixteen miles. It
took three days to accomplish the journey, with hard travelling;
a considerable part of the way being very rocky, as well as
mountainous. We arrived among Friends at Pughtown, on
fifth day evening; and had a meeting appointed there the next
day, at two o’clock in the afternoon, which we attended accordingly.
On seventh day had a meeting at the Ridge. On first
day at Centre, near Winchester; and the two following days
had meetings at Hopewell and Berkley. I was largely led forth
in these meetings, to show to the people the inconsistency and
unrighteousness of holding our fellow creatures in bondage, and
the evil tendency of bringing up our children and families on
the fruits of their labour, wrested from them by violence, without
paying them an adequate reward for the same. I likewise
opened to them the folly and deception of all their profession of
worshipping that Being, who is perfect in justice, purity and
holiness, while their hands are full of violence and oppression,
and they living in luxury and idleness on their unrighteous
gain. The Lord’s power was exalted in these meetings, and
truth reigned.</p>

<p>After the latter meeting we proceeded on our way towards
Baltimore, where we arrived on seventh day evening; attending
meetings at Fredericktown and New Market, on our way
thither. On first day, the 17th of 10th month, I attended
Friends’ meetings in that city; the Western District in the
morning, and the Eastern District in the afternoon. I was
silent in the former, but in the latter, I was largely led forth in
gospel communication. As notice had been spread among the
citizens of other professions, the meeting was large, and the
divine power was felt to preside, which brought a precious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381"></a>[Pg 381]</span>
solemnity over the meeting, and truth was raised into dominion.</p>

<p>Here we met with our friend Elizabeth Coggeshall from New-York,
with her companion Judith Coffin, from Nantucket; also
our ancient friend William Rickman, from England. We were
mutually glad in seeing each other. Elizabeth felt a concern
to see the members of our society, select from those of other
societies in each meeting, accordingly a Friend, at her request,
in the morning meeting when the service of the first meeting
was over, proposed the same to the assembly; when those who
were not members quietly withdrew, and our dear friend had
good service among them. This also opened an opportunity
for me to throw in my mite, and set a seal to the service. A
similar opportunity was likewise had with Friends at the close
of the afternoon meeting in the Eastern District, which was
also a favoured time.</p>

<p>And as I had felt my mind somewhat similarly engaged in
coming into the city, it opened the way to spread my exercise
before Friends; which was that of the more select service of
seeing the active members and heads of families of both sexes
together. I had an opportunity with those of this description in
the Western District, and afterwards with those of the Eastern;
and was glad in believing that divine love was near, favouring
with His enlivening, reconciling presence; which raised a hope,
that through the divine blessing, the opportunities would not
prove altogether unfruitful, for some disunity and jealousies had
prevailed among the members of society in this city.</p>

<p>The next day being Friends’ meeting day, I felt most easy
to stay and attend it. I also found my mind led to some further
service among the citizens at large: for although I had had a
public opportunity on first day evening, which seemed for the
present to ease my mind, yet a renewed exercise on that account
induced a belief it would be right to give the citizens generally
another invitation; which Friends readily agreed to, and spread
the notice accordingly. It was a very large meeting, and
through gracious condescension a highly favoured season; the
Lord’s power was felt to preside, and a precious solemnity spread<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382"></a>[Pg 382]</span>
over the assembly, and I took my leave of them in much peace
of mind.</p>

<p>This closed my service among them. The two following
days we rode to Wilmington, where we arrived on sixth day
evening. On seventh day evening we had a large meeting by
appointment, with Friends and the inhabitants of the town.
This was a solemn instructive season, worthy of grateful remembrance.
We also attended the morning meeting of Friends
the next day, and then proceeded to Chester, parting with my
Friends in much sweet peace and unity. Here we had a large
solemn meeting in the evening, among the few Friends of that
place and the inhabitants of the town. I trust, through
heavenly goodness, it proved an instructive edifying season to
many.</p>

<p>The two following days, I attended the monthly meetings of
Providence and Darby. On fourth day morning we proceeded
to Philadelphia. We staid in the city until the following third
day, and attended all the meetings of Friends there; some by
appointment, and the others as they came in course. We were
at two of their monthly meetings, and their quarterly meeting.
The meetings were generally crowded, and at several many of
the people were obliged to stand outside of the doors, for want
of room. Through unmerited mercy the Lord’s power was felt
to preside, producing a precious solemnity over those large promiscuous
gatherings, and by which truth was raised into dominion.
Surely it was the Lord’s doing, and marvellous in mine
eyes. It was, I trust, a time of renewed visitation to many,
especially to the beloved youth.</p>

<p>We left the city on third day morning, and proceeded to
Germantown, where by previous appointment we had a large
meeting at the eleventh hour. The two following days we
attended Friends’ quarterly meeting at Horsham; and on sixth
day, had a large public meeting at Byberry. These were all
favoured instructive seasons, in which the Lord’s presence
was manifested for our help, and were worthy of grateful
remembrance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383"></a>[Pg 383]</span></p>

<p>On seventh day we attended a meeting at Bristol; and at
evening crossed the river Delaware to Burlington, and attended
Friends’ forenoon and afternoon meetings on first day. These
were large favoured meetings, in which truth reigned.</p>

<p>On second day, the 8th of 11th month we proceeded to Trenton
and had a large meeting there in the evening, with the few
Friends of that place, and the inhabitants of the town, in which
divers essential doctrines of the gospel were opened to the consideration
of the assembly. It was a solemn meeting, and I
parted with them in true peace of mind, which is the certain
and consolatory result of disinterested obedience, and faithfulness
to manifested duty.</p>

<p>We proceeded on third day, on our way to New-York, where
we arrived the next day in season to attend Friends’ meeting in
Pearl-street; it being their usual meeting day. The meeting
was generally gathered when I got in, having had some
distance to travel to reach there, which occasioned my being a
few minutes after the time. My mind, soon after taking my
seat, was brought under a renewed exercise, on account of the
members of our society mixing in with the associations of other
people, in their governments and politics, their Bible and
Missionary societies, and pretended charity associations; which
had a very hurtful tendency, by leavening the minds of
Friends, and leading them to assimilate with the spirit of the
world; and turning them away from the simplicity, of our profession,
thereby neglecting to support our Christian testimonies,
as it regards plainness of speech, deportment, and apparel. Such
conduct is particularly wounding to some of the beloved youth,
for they seeing their elder brethren, and especially some who
were sometimes active in our meetings for discipline, join with
such associations, it leads them into a free familiarity and friendship
with such as are light and vain in their conversation and
deportment, by which their tender minds are greatly wounded;
and they led off from the cross, and a strict regard to that
sobriety of conduct, which truth requires of all its professors.
I was led to communicate largely on those subjects, in a close
searching testimony; and the Lord’s power was felt to prevail,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384"></a>[Pg 384]</span>
and the meeting generally brought under a solemn covering.
It proved a season of favour, and the right-minded were made
to rejoice.</p>

<p>Feeling my mind impressed with a concern to appoint a meeting
for the citizens at large, the appointment was accordingly
made at seven o’clock the ensuing evening. It was a very large
collection, more than the house could contain; and was a highly
favoured season. A very precious solemnity was spread over
the assembly in general; and when I sat down, after standing
nearly two hours, I turned my eyes over the congregation, and
all was quiet and still, and every countenance seemed expressive
of the solemnity felt, which united us together and clothed
us as with a mantle of love. Surely it was the Lord’s doing,
and marvellous in our eyes.</p>

<p>The next day I attended Friends’ meeting near the Bowery,
as it came in course; and some notice being given of my intending
to be there, we had the company of a number of their
neighbours of other societies. This was also a very instructive
favoured season.</p>

<p>The ensuing evening I had another appointed meeting for
the citizens at large, in Friends’ meeting-house at Liberty-street.
This was rather a trying meeting; as many who attended
were such as had settled down in a form, and were difficult to
reach, which makes hard labour for the truly exercised ministers.
However I had a hope the season would prove profitable
to some, and I left them with peace of mind.</p>

<p>This meeting closed my labours in this journey, and the next
morning we rode home, the 12th of the 11th month, 1819. I
found my family and friends in usual health, and glad to see
me, which rendered it a cause of mutual joy, and filled my
heart with gratitude and thanksgiving to the God and Father
of all our sure mercies, who had led about, instructed and preserved
me, through all, to the praise of his great and excellent
name.</p>

<p>I was from home in this journey about three months, and
travelled nearly twelve hundred miles, and attended eighty-seven
meetings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385"></a>[Pg 385]</span></p>

<p>First day, 14th. I sat with my Friends in our own meeting,
in which I was largely led forth in ministry, setting forth, as it
opened on my mind, the cause why so little progress was made
in reformation, and the true spiritual or real Christian life; and
showing that it was principally, as it then appeared in the openings
of truth, occasioned by the visited children of our heavenly
Father, not keeping close to that which first visited them,
and opened their understanding; but letting their minds out to
worldly things, and that by opening the way to a free and
familiar converse with the people of the world, many were led
and induced thereby to join with them in their manners, maxims,
interests and worldly policies, by which means they were
so yoked together in a free and open friendship, as thereby to
become weakened and brought into bondage to them; so as to
be ashamed and afraid to stand upright, and bear a faithful testimony
against this worldly spirit and its fruits; by which the
testimonies of truth were in a great measure let fall, for fear of
offending these their worldly-minded associates, by which the
promotion of the cause of truth was greatly obstructed, and its
faithful testimony-bearers grieved, and made to go mourning on
their way.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended our monthly meeting, in which I also
had some close searching labour to stir up Friends to more diligence
and faithfulness in the support of our Christian testimonies;
and cautioning them against a worldly spirit, which would
lead to extortion and grinding the faces of the poor; for this is
very reproachful for any Christian professor, and more so for us,
who are making a more exalted profession than any others who
go under the Christian name.</p>

<p>First day, the 21st. My mind to-day was led into a near
feeling sympathy with such as had been visited with the day-spring
from on high, but who had not so fully given up to the
pointing of truth, in what are generally termed little things, as
they ought; the natural tendency of which is to lead the mind
into a doubting state. For when the creature, in his own will,
takes the liberty of judging for himself, of what is little, or what
is great, he departs from the true standard, and has no certain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386"></a>[Pg 386]</span>
evidence to walk by; for if he has a right to judge for himself in
one case, why not in every other. Here doubting will arise in
his mind, of what is, or is not, agreeable to the divine will; as
nothing can give the mind certain evidence, but faithfully complying
with the evident sensations which the light of truth opens
upon it, let them be what the creature may judge to be small or
great; for we have no more reason or right to refuse complying
with a small requisition, than we have a great one, if the
requisition proceeds from the same source. The subject was so
opened as to affect many minds with tenderness and contrition;
and had an humbling, solemnizing effect on the meeting in
general, and was, I believe, gladdening to many minds.</p>

<p>Fifth day. Attended our meeting in silence, which was very
acceptable to me.</p>

<p>First day, the 28th. Mostly silent in meeting to-day.</p>

<p>On my return home from my late journey, I felt my mind
drawn in sympathy, attended with a concern to pay a religious
visit to the neighbouring inhabitants in the compass of our quarterly
meeting. This concern I opened to my friends the first
monthly meeting after my return, and received their full unity
therein; but taking a severe cold soon after I came home, I continued
indisposed for some weeks, which with some necessary
concerns, prevented my entering on the visit, until after our succeeding
monthly meeting. The fourth day following, the 22d
of 12th month, I proceeded therein, accompanied by my wife
and my kinsman, Isaac Hicks, of Westbury. We were from
home five days, and attended six meetings, mostly among those
of other societies. It was a time of deep exercise to me, being led
in the line of searching labour, pointing to a reform in manners
and conduct; and showing the fallacy of all ceremonial religion
in the observation of days, and complying with outward ordinances;
which do not in the least tend to make the comers
thereunto a whit the better, as it respects the conscience, but
lead the observers thereof into a form, without the power.</p>

<p>We returned home the following second day. I tarried at
home until the beginning of the next week, when feeling my
mind drawn to attend the monthly meeting of Friends in New-<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387"></a>[Pg 387]</span>York,
I again left home, accompanied by the aforesaid friend.
We were at the monthly meeting on fourth day, in which I had
some close exercise, the meeting having much business before it,
and one case in particular was very trying, in which Friends
were divided, and two or three unqualified individuals seemed
determined, for a considerable time, to compel the meeting to
comply with their unsanctified wills; but as Friends who were
rightly exercised, patiently kept up the travail, and withstood
them, truth was raised into dominion, and by its power silenced
all their cavilling, and united the meeting in a right conclusion.
The meeting for worship and that for discipline continued
upwards of six hours.</p>

<p>We left the city soon after the close of this long meeting, and
passed over the river to Brooklyn, where by previous appointment
we had a meeting that evening, composed of the different professions
of the inhabitants of that place, very few Friends residing
there. The meeting was pretty large, and in the main
satisfactory. The next day we proceeded to Flushing, and
attended their monthly meeting. I was silent in the meeting
for worship, but had some good service in that for discipline.
We also had an appointed meeting in the evening for the inhabitants
of the town, which was large and solemn. The next day
we returned to Newtown, and had a meeting at Friends’ meeting-house
at the Kilns in that place, at the eleventh hour;
and another in the evening at the sixth hour, in the village.
They were both favoured meetings. We returned to Flushing
after the latter meeting, and lodged with our kind friend Walter
Farrington, and the next day rode home and found my family
well.</p>

<p>First day, the 9th of 1st month, 1820. I sat with my friends
at home in our own meeting to-day, which I considered as no
small privilege.</p>

<p>On second day morning I was early informed, that my kinsman
and kind fellow traveller Isaac Hicks, was taken with a
severe illness, about ten o’clock the preceding evening, and lay
at the point of death. I hastened to see him, and found him
nearly breathing his last, being past noticing any thing by his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388"></a>[Pg 388]</span>
external senses. It was a sudden and unexpected trial to me, to
be thus almost instantaneously separated from such a kind and
valued friend, who had for a number of years devoted himself in
divers ways, to promote the cause of truth and righteousness in
the earth; and in particular, by encouraging and accompanying
Friends in the ministry, when travelling in truth’s service,
especially myself, having been with me in several long journeys,
as well as divers short ones. I parted with him at the close
of one of the latter, on the seventh day afternoon before his
death, at his own house, and apparently in usual health:
although he had been for a considerable time previous thereto,
much afflicted, at times, with severe pain in his breast and shortness
of breath, which created great suffering during their continuance.
He had a return thereof the evening before I last
parted with him, which occasioned him to observe to me, that
he thought he should ere long be taken off in one of those
attacks; but I then thought quite otherwise, as in other respects
he appeared to be in very good health, and had a very healthy
countenance.</p>

<p>Such sudden attacks prove with indubitable evidence, that
mortality is so closely interwoven in the very constitution of
these animal bodies, that the present moment is the only time
we can call our own; and which continually announce the
impressive language: “Be ye therefore ready.”</p>

<p>Such sudden and unexpected separations from our endeared
friends make the loss seem greater, not only to their families and
near connexions, but to their friends in general, and particularly
so to those who knew their real worth. But it ever affords a
soothing consolation, and induces to acquiesce in the divine
will, when we have evident cause to hope that our loss, which
is but for a short time, is their eternal gain.</p>

<p>I attended the funeral of my beloved friend, which was large
and solemn; and I was led forth in an impressive testimony to
the truths of the gospel; inviting the people to inquire, and see,
and taste for themselves, that the Lord is good.</p>

<p>I continued at home until the following seventh day, when I
again proceeded on my visit to the neighbouring towns and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389"></a>[Pg 389]</span>
villages. I was from home about thirteen days and attended
fifteen meetings, returning home on sixth day, the 11th of 2d
month, 1820. My service in many of those opportunities was
very arduous; the lukewarmness and insensibility of the people,
as to any right religious concern, make hard work for the honest
labourers, in this day of ease and carnal security. But true
peace of mind, the sure result of faithfulness, crowns the attempts
at doing good, as it makes hard things easy and bitter things
sweet.</p>

<p>I tarried at home until the latter end of the next week, in the
course of which I had a very severe attack of bodily indisposition,
occasioned by the gravel, with which I have been afflicted
at times, for near twenty years. These warnings are designed
to spur us on to our duty, as they continually announce to
the enlightened mind this very useful memento: “Remember
to die.”</p>

<p>In the latter end of the week, there came to my house my
much esteemed friend and kinsman Edward Hicks, from Newtown,
in Bucks county, Pennsylvania, on a religious visit to our
parts, with his companion James Walton, an elder. I accompanied
them the next day to a meeting they had appointed at
Westbury. It was very large, in which Edward had very good
service, being largely led forth to open to the people many important
doctrines of the Christian religion. I accompanied him
to all the meetings he had among us except one; and in some
of them had a portion of the service laid upon me, particularly
in the meeting at Bethpage.</p>

<p>I accompanied my friend to four meetings after this, in which
he was generally favoured to open things suitable to the states
of the people; his gift being searching and lively. After his
service was over in the meeting at Cowneck, on first day, I was
led forth in a short testimony; and the meeting closed under
an evident sense that truth reigned. Our next meeting was
the day following at Rockaway, on second day, the 28th of 2d
month. It was in the main a favoured opportunity. My part
was to sit in silence. After this meeting I parted with my
beloved friend and his companion, in the fellowship of the gos<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390"></a>[Pg 390]</span>pel;
they proceeded towards New-York, and I returned home
that evening, and found my family well.</p>

<p>First day, the 5th of 3d month. I attended our own meeting,
which through heavenly help proved a very precious instructive
season. It was larger than usual, many coming in who did
not often attend, to whom the gospel was preached in the demonstration
of the spirit, through which truth was raised into
dominion, causing the hearts of many to be warmed within
them by the influence of its power, and manifesting itself by
much brokenness and contrition of spirit.</p>

<p>Second day, the 13th. Attended the funeral of our friend
Charles Frost, at which there was a large collection of friends
and neighbours. A meeting was held on the occasion, which
was a favoured one, and, I trust, a profitable opportunity to some
present, and worthy of grateful remembrance.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1820, being, with several other friends, on an
appointment from the yearly meeting, requiring our care and
attention in the northern quarters, and having for some time
previously felt my mind drawn to visit some of the meetings of
Friends, within the compass of Farmington and Duanesburgh
quarterly meetings, I obtained the unity and concurrence of my
Friends at home to attend thereto, after accomplishing the service
of the yearly meeting. I accordingly set out in the 9th
month, and was favoured to go through the visit with peace to
my own mind; for He, who is the alone sure helper of all his
dependant children, graciously manifested himself to be near, for
my help and encouragement in the travail and exercise that I
was engaged in, for the promotion of his noble cause of truth
and righteousness in the earth; and in a way, that was often
marvellous in mine eyes, tending to inspire my soul with deep
and humble gratitude and thanksgiving, for the unmerited
favour.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1822, I opened to my Friends a prospect,
which for a considerable time had been impressive on my mind,
to make a visit in the love of the gospel, to Friends and others
in some parts of the yearly meeting of Philadelphia; and, if
way should open for it, to visit some of the families of Friends in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391"></a>[Pg 391]</span>
that city, and also to attend the yearly meeting at Baltimore.
They united with me in the concern, and left me at liberty to
proceed therein. I set out in the 7th month, with David Seaman
as my companion. We had a large favoured meeting at
Flushing, which was strengthening and comforting to my mind,
in first setting out in this arduous engagement, and excited
gratitude for the unmerited mercy. After leaving Flushing on
our way to New-York, my prospect of a meeting at Hester-street,
which I had a view of several weeks before I left home,
revived with renewed weight; and although from the consternation
and interrupted state of the citizens, owing to the prevalence
of fever in the city, I had given up the prospect on leaving
home, yet I now saw that I could not depart from the city with
a quiet mind, unless I had a meeting agreeably to my former
view. Accordingly, when I got into town I opened my concern
to some of my friends there, who readily united therewith, and
notice was given; and one of the Friends who attended about
the door at the gathering of the meeting, said there were more
people collected than had ever been at any former time in that
place; several hundreds, he said, went away, who could not
get into the house for want of room. I had a full opportunity
to clear my mind among the people, most of whom were very
solid and attentive. Thus we have great cause of gratitude to
the gracious Care-taker of his faithfully devoted children, who
opens a way for them, when some are ready to conclude there
is no way. But he opens a way for those, which none but
himself can shut, to the praise of his own great and adorable
name, who is over all, blessed for ever.</p>

<p>We then proceeded to Newark, and had a meeting in the
court-house. There was a pretty large collection of the inhabitants,
among whom I had strength and utterance given to open
many important doctrines of the Christian religion, in a clear and
impressive manner, which appeared sensibly to affect and impress
the minds of the sober and well inclined; but many appeared
very ignorant and inexperienced as to the real truths of the
gospel. But having fully cleared my mind among them, I left
them with the answer of peace, and proceeded to Plainfield. We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392"></a>[Pg 392]</span>
attended the meeting there, which was large for the place; and
it was favoured in an eminent manner, to our mutual comfort.
We then rode to Kingwood, and had a full and comfortable
meeting there; after which we went to Solebury, in Pennsylvania,
and had a meeting at the sixth hour in the evening. It
was a large meeting, in which I was led to discharge myself
faithfully in a close searching testimony. It was a very solemn
quiet opportunity, and I parted with them in peace of mind.</p>

<p>We afterwards attended meetings at Buckingham, Plumbstead,
Wrightstown, Makefield, and Newtown: and we have abundant
cause to bless the name of Israel’s unslumbering Shepherd, who
hath graciously condescended to manifest his presence and power
for our help and support, opening my way in a marvellous manner
in all the meetings I have attended since I left home, uniting my
friends in a joint travail for the promotion of his blessed cause;
truth prevailing in every meeting, and running as precious ointment
over the assemblies, bearing down all opposition, and
spreading, by its power, a sweet and precious solemnity over all.
Surely it is the Lord’s doing, and marvellous in our eyes: and
what is the greatest cause of gratitude and thanksgiving to the
benevolent Author of all our richest blessings, is, that he causes
all these favours to bow my spirit in deep humiliation and fear
before him, as unworthy of the least of his mercies. To the
sufficiency of his grace, may all the praise and glory be ascribed,
nothing due to man.</p>

<p>We then attended meetings at Horsham, Upper Dublin, North
Wales, Plymouth, Providence, Pikeland, Westchester, London
Grove, and Deer Creek; and my spirit is humbled in a deep
feeling sense of the Lord’s goodness vouchsafed for our help,
opening a way in the minds of my friends generally to receive
the testimonies given me to bear, for the promotion of his righteous
cause, with marks of apparent joy and satisfaction, and to our
mutual comfort. We reached Baltimore on the 25th of 10th
month; and the meeting of Ministers and Elders was opened
on the next day at the tenth hour. The yearly meeting continued
till sixth day evening, and was acknowledged to be the
largest and the most favoured meeting they had known for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393"></a>[Pg 393]</span>
several years past. The unity of Friends with my exercises in
the public meetings, and in those for discipline, was truly grateful,
and tended to humble and inspire my mind with gratitude and
thanksgiving to my heavenly Father.</p>

<p>I did not feel myself at liberty to leave the city at the close of
the yearly meeting, believing that some more public service
among the people was required of me. I had accordingly a
public meeting in the Eastern District, on seventh day evening.
It was very large; and among the various subjects that opened
for communication to those assembled, I was led to expose the
iniquity and deformity of the cruel practice of holding our fellow
creatures in bondage, and the injustice and inconsistency of
Friends doing any act where the right of slavery was acknowledged
and supported; and, I think, I was enabled to do it in a
more full and impressive manner than ever before. We had a
very interesting and solemn meeting; truth appeared to gain
the victory, and reigned over all. On first day I attended Friends’
meetings for the Western District, both in the forenoon and afternoon.
They were very large; and I had a full opportunity in
the morning of clearing myself among them. We had a precious,
powerful meeting; and among the divers states addressed, the
slave-holders were peculiarly the objects of my exercise and
concern. The afternoon meeting I sat in silence, except the
expression of a few words just at the close, in taking leave of them,
and bidding all farewell.</p>

<p>In the evening I had a precious interesting opportunity with
the coloured people, in Friends’ meeting-house in the Western
District. It was said by Friends to be much the largest known
in that place. It was a very quiet, solemn meeting; and the
minds of all, both white and coloured, seemed animated with
gladness and joy for the favour dispensed, and gave manifestations
of their thankfulness and gratitude for the opportunity.</p>

<p>We then proceeded towards Philadelphia, attending several
meetings on our way, which were greatly favoured, and crowned
with the divine presence and power, in such a manner as to be
marvellous in our eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394"></a>[Pg 394]</span></p>

<p>We arrived in Philadelphia in the early part of 12th month;
and I immediately entered on the arduous concern which I had
had in prospect, and which I was favoured soon comfortably to
accomplish. We visited the families composing Green-street
monthly meeting, being in number about one hundred and forty;
and we also attended that monthly meeting, and the monthly
meeting for the Northern District. This closed my visit there,
and set me at liberty to turn my face homeward. We left Philadelphia
on the 25th of 12th month, and attended several meetings
in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, on our way home, which
were large and solemn opportunities. We were favoured to
reach our homes with feelings of thanksgiving to our gracious
Preserver, and with the enjoyment of that precious peace, which
is experienced by those whose minds are stayed on God; as the
prophet declared in his appeal to Jehovah: “Thou wilt keep
him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee, because he
trusteth in thee.” And he subjoins, for our encouragement:
“Trust in the Lord for ever; for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting
strength.” May we all dwell here; then nothing can
hurt or harm us; for the Lord our Preserver will turn all the
designs and cunning devices of those that rise up against us
upon their own heads, and cause them to fall into their own pit.</p>

<p>In the latter part of 1823, I felt myself engaged to make a
religious visit to Friends and others in several of the lower quarterly
meetings; and having obtained the unity of my friends, I set
out in the 10th month, with Samuel Willis as my companion.
After having meetings at Westchester and Mamaroneck, we
attended the select quarterly meeting at Purchase, which was
small, many of the members being absent. They appeared to
be clothed with much weakness: I was led into a feeling sympathy
with them, and way was opened to communicate to their
states, in a way that was comforting and encouraging to the
honest-hearted. The next day was the quarterly meeting of
discipline. It was large; and, I think, in the main it was a
favoured instructive season, although considerably hurt by a long
tedious communication from a Friend, not sufficiently clothed
with life to make it useful. But the society is in such a mixed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395"></a>[Pg 395]</span>
and unstable state, and many who presume to be teachers in it
are so far from keeping on the original foundation, <i>the light and
spirit of truth</i>, and are so built up in mere tradition, that I fear
a great portion of the ministry amongst us is doing more harm
than good, and is leading back to the weak and beggarly elements
to which some seem desirous to be again in bondage.</p>

<p>After leaving Purchase, we had a pretty large and favoured
meeting at North Castle; and next day we went to Oblong, and
attended their meeting on first day. It was large, and I had an
open time among them, through the prevalence of that power
which opens and none can shut, and when he shuts none can
open. Truth reigned, and the people generally, I believe, were
instructed, comforted, and edified. I parted with them in true
peace of mind, which leads my heart into deep humility, and
inspires it with gratitude and thanksgiving to the great and
blessed Author of all our mercies. We had a meeting at the
Branch, and then proceeded to Nine Partners, and attended the
select quarterly meeting. It was much like some other meetings
of this kind, hard and not very fruitful. The members of those
meetings are too generally falling more short of coming up faithfully,
according to their stations, than most of the other departments
of our society. We attended the quarterly meeting for
discipline, also that at Stanford, and soon after turned our faces
homeward; where we arrived, accompanied with the fresh feelings
of that love that many waters cannot quench; even that
powerful love that is stronger than death, and binds together in
an indissoluble bond, all the new-born children of the heavenly
Father. May we all seek for it, and dwell in it. It will cast
out all fear, and clothe with that innocent boldness, which will
enable us to withstand all the dark powers of antichrist and his
agents, and all their deceivableness of unrighteousness; and
will raise above the fear of death, with all his mis-shapen and
ugly forms, and clothe with the joys of God’s salvation here and
for ever, as we continue steadfast in the faith that overcomes the
world.</p>

<p class="chap-head">Visit to Baltimore to attend the yearly meeting in 1824.&mdash;Visit to the inhabitants
of the eastern part of Long Island in 1825.&mdash;Visit to Scipio quarterly meeting
in 1825.&mdash;Visit to Southern and Concord quarterly meetings in Pennsylvania

and Ohio in 1828.</p>


<p>In the summer of 1824, I had the concurrence of my friends
to attend the quarterly meeting of Cornwall and Stanford, which
I accomplished to my own peace and comfort. And in the fall
of the same year, they also united with a concern which had
impressed my mind, to attend the ensuing yearly meeting in
Baltimore. This engagement, through the mercy of Him who
has hitherto helped me, I was favoured to accomplish to the
peace and satisfaction of my own mind. The yearly meeting
for discipline opened on second day, and continued by adjournments
until the following fifth day, in the afternoon of which it
closed, under a comfortable evidence of divine favour attending.
I think it was, in its several sittings, one of the most satisfactory
yearly meetings I ever attended, and the business was conducted
in much harmony and brotherly love.</p>

<p>In Philadelphia, on my return, I had a severe attack of bodily
indisposition; so that, for some time, there seemed but little
prospect of my recovery. I lodged at the house of my very
kind friend Samuel R. Fisher, who, with his worthy children,
extended to me the most affectionate care and attention; and I
had also the kind sympathy of a large portion of Friends in
that city.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1825, I obtained the concurrence of my
friends to make a visit, in gospel love, to the inhabitants of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397"></a>[Pg 397]</span>
eastern part of Long Island, and I proceeded therein, with
Samuel Willis as my companion. The people appeared open
to receive us, and the meetings at the several places we visited,
were pretty fully attended. Many minds were humbled
and contrited, and truth’s testimonies exalted, and the people
generally comforted, and, I trust, edified.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1825, being on an appointment of the yearly
meeting to attend the opening of Scipio quarterly meeting, I
obtained the unity of my friends to attend some meetings among
Friends and others, on my way going and returning. The
quarterly meeting in its several sittings, was conducted in much
apparent harmony and condescension; the truth was so effectually
raised into dominion over all, that if there were any discordant
spirits present, they were all kept down and subdued
by the prevalence of its power; and Friends were united in the
bond of brotherly affection, and the faithful were made to rejoice
for the unmerited favour. The meeting closed on the 30th of
9th month, with a very large solemn public meeting; the public
service therein fell to the lot of Thankful Merritt and myself,
and Thankful closed the meeting in sweet solemn supplication.
In returning home, I attended several meetings which were
large, and, through the condescending goodness of the Shepherd
of Israel, were favoured satisfactory seasons, in which truth was
raised into dominion, and a precious solemnity prevailed.</p>

<p>In the latter part of 1826, my friends united with a concern,
which had been for a considerable time impressive on my mind,
to make a visit in the love of the gospel, to Southern and
Concord quarterly meetings, in the yearly meeting of Philadelphia.
I accordingly set out in the 11th month, with Jesse Merritt
as my companion. In passing through Philadelphia, we
attended Mulberry-street meeting in the forenoon, and Green-street
in the afternoon. They were both very large meetings,
many more coming together than the houses could contain.
Truth was powerfully raised into dominion, and at the close of
each meeting, many Friends manifested, in an affectionate
manner, their unity and satisfaction with my labours amongst
them. We then proceeded on the further service on which we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398"></a>[Pg 398]</span>
had set out, taking several meetings on the way, which were large
and solemn opportunities, and favoured with the overshadowing
wing of divine kindness; and having accomplished the prospects
in view, we turned our faces homewards, having thankfully to
acknowledge that best help had been near, enabling me to discharge
myself faithfully in the various meetings, to the comfort
and peace of my own mind.</p>

<p>In the early part of 1827, with the unity of my friends, I
entered into the engagement of making a religious visit to the
families of Friends within our own and Westbury monthly
meeting, and I was favoured to go through this arduous service
to the satisfaction and peace of my own mind.</p>

<p>Having felt an exercise and travail of spirit in the course of
last year, to make a religious visit in the love of the gospel, to
Friends and others in some parts of our own yearly meeting,
and in the compass of the yearly meetings of Philadelphia,
Baltimore, Ohio, Indiana, and a few meetings in Virginia; and
apprehending the time had come to move therein, I spread the
concern before my friends at Jericho monthly meeting, held the
20th of 3d month, 1828, and obtained their unity and concurrence
therein. This concern, with the certificate from our
monthly meeting, I laid before our quarterly meeting held at
Westbury, the 24th of 4th month following; and obtained their
unity and concurrence, with an endorsement thereof on my
certificate from the monthly meeting.</p>

<p>I left home the 28th of 4th month, the week after our quarterly
meeting, in order to accomplish the service above alluded
to; and attended the three quarterly meetings of Purchase,
Nine Partners, and Stanford, as they came in their usual course.
On my way home, I attended Oblong monthly meeting, also
four particular meetings, three of which were appointed at my
request. In all these meetings the Lord, our gracious helper,
manifested himself to be near for our support, making way for
us at times where there seemed to be no way, to our humbling
admiration. I was from home in the prosecution of this little
tour of duty, two weeks and two days. After this I tarried at
and about home until after our yearly meeting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399"></a>[Pg 399]</span></p>

<p>Soon after this I again left home, on the 14th of 6th month,
and rode to New-York. The day following being the first of
the week, we attended the morning and afternoon meetings of
Friends in the city, which, through the gracious extendings of
heavenly help, proved to be comfortable edifying seasons. My
esteemed friend Jesse Merritt, an elder of our monthly meeting,
accompanied me in this journey. We left New-York on second
day, after taking a sympathetic farewell of our friends in the
city, and proceeded on our journey to Rahway in New Jersey,
and lodged with our kind friend William Shotwell, and the next
day had an appointed meeting in that village. It was truly a
comfortable edifying opportunity; many truths of the gospel
were clearly opened to the audience, humbling and contriting
many who were present; a sense of which inspired our minds
with gratitude and thanksgiving to the blessed Author of all
our mercies.</p>

<p>The next day being the fourth of the week, we attended
Friends’ monthly meeting held at Plainfield, for Rahway and
Plainfield. The meeting for worship was large, many of the
neighbouring people of other societies coming in, to whom the
gospel was freely preached in the demonstration of the spirit,
solemnizing the assembly, and truth was raised into victory over
all. My mind was also comforted in the meeting for discipline,
in observing the harmony and brotherly condescension of Friends,
in the orderly conducting the affairs of the Church.</p>

<p>The next day we proceeded on our journey to Kingwood,
and put up with our kind friend Henry Clifton. We had an
appointed meeting here the day after at the tenth hour, and
although the number of Friends was small that constituted this
meeting, yet Friends being careful to give their neighbours of
other societies information thereof, we had a very full meeting;
and it proved a very solemn impressive opportunity in which
truth reigned, comforting and contriting many minds.</p>

<p>After this we passed on to Solebury in Pennsylvania, and
lodged with our kind friend Watson Fell, who met us at Kingwood
and kindly took us to his house. The next day we had
an appointed meeting here at the fourth hour in the afternoon.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400"></a>[Pg 400]</span>
It was a solemn opportunity, and I parted with them under a
thankful sense of the unmerited favour. We then rode home
with our kind friend Moses Eastburn; and the next day being
first day, and the 22d of 6th month, we attended Buckingham
meeting in the morning, and had an appointed meeting at
Plumbstead at four o’clock in the afternoon. After this we rode
home with our worthy friend Israel Lancaster, and on second
day had a meeting at Wrightstown; on third day in the forenoon,
we attended Newtown meeting; and at the fourth hour
in the afternoon had an appointed meeting at Makefield. These
were all large favoured meetings, in which the gospel was
preached in the demonstration of the spirit, and many hearts
were humbled and contrited, and a precious solemnity spread
over the meetings, comforting and rejoicing the honest-hearted,
and to the praise of Him, who is calling us to glory and virtue.</p>

<p>On fourth day, the 25th, we attended a meeting at the Falls;
on fifth day were at Middletown; on sixth day at Byberry; and
on seventh day at Abington. These meetings were all large
and very solemn, and the canopy of love, in a very comforting
manner, was felt to spread over the assemblies; and much kindness
and friendly regard were manifested towards us, not only
by our friends, but by the people in general of other societies,
who attended the meetings.</p>

<p>We attended Horsham meeting in the morning, on first day,
the 29th, and had an appointed meeting at Upper Dublin at
the fourth hour in the afternoon. They were very large; more
attended than the houses could contain. As the last meeting
was assembling there came on a heavy shower of rain, accompanied
with an uncommon time of lightning, and very heavy
peals of thunder: many flashes of the lightning appeared to
strike down to the earth within a very small distance of the
meeting-house, which brought a great solemnity over the meeting,
and I was thankful in observing the stillness and quiet
which prevailed generally among the people. These meetings
were very solemn seasons, in which truth reigned, and I parted
with them in peace of mind, and the fresh feelings of gospel
love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401"></a>[Pg 401]</span></p>

<p>Our kind friend Joseph Foulke met us at Horsham; and after
the latter meeting conducted us to his house, where we met a
very cordial welcome, and were favoured with the company and
conversation of his ancient and very worthy father Hugh Foulke.
The two following days we attended meetings at North Wales
and Plymouth. These were large favoured meetings, in which
many truths of the gospel were largely opened to the edification,
comfort, and apparent satisfaction, of those large assemblies, and
to the peace of my own mind. It was the Lord’s doing, and
to him belongs all the praise, nothing due to man.</p>

<p>From thence we proceeded to Charlestown, and lodged with
our kind friend James Wood; and the next day, being the
fourth day of the week, we attended their meeting. After this
we rode to Pikeland, where we were very kindly entertained by
our friends Emmor Kimber and wife, and had an appointed
meeting there the next day. We tarried here until the next
morning; and then proceeded on to Uwchlan, where we had a
meeting, by previous appointment, at the eleventh hour; and
although it was in the midst of their harvest, and the care
necessary for getting it in, very urgent, as many of their fields
of grain appeared to be over-ripe, yet to our own and our friends’
admiration, the meetings were unusually large, frequently many
more assembled than the houses could contain. The people
were generally very solid and quiet, and very attentive to hear
what was communicated; and many minds were humbled and
contrited, and truth’s testimonies exalted, to the mutual comfort
and encouragement of the honest-hearted, and to the general
satisfaction of the assembled multitudes; and my mind was
deeply humbled and made thankful for the continuance of those
unmerited favours.</p>

<p>On seventh day, the 5th of 7th month, we attended a
meeting at Downing’s Town, held in an orchard, under the
shade of the apple trees; which was a large, solemn, satisfactory
meeting. A division having taken place in the Society of
Friends, and the meeting-house in this place being in possession
of the party termed Orthodox, they refused to permit Friends to
occupy it on this occasion. There were, however, more attended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402"></a>[Pg 402]</span>
the meeting, than could have got into the house, if we had been
permitted to use it. The next day we attended Friends’ meeting
at East Caln; and notice having been given of our intention
of attending it, the house, although very large, did not contain
more than three quarters of the people that assembled. It was
a season to be remembered with gratitude, in which the Lord’s
presence was felt to preside, humbling and contriting many
hearts, and truth was raised into victory over all.</p>

<p>On second day we attended a meeting, by appointment, at
Sadsbury; and on third day their monthly meeting. On fourth
day we had an appointed meeting at Lampeter. These were
all favoured opportunities, wherein the Lord’s power was manifested
for our help, rejoicing and encouraging the honest-hearted,
and settling and confirming the wavering, who were halting
between two opinions, but were now satisfied, and openly
declared themselves on the side of Friends, some of whom had
previously gone with our opposers, but were now convinced of
the impropriety of their conduct, and cheerfully united with
Friends.</p>

<p>After the latter meeting, we dined with our friend Thomas
Peart. We then took leave of our friends in near unity, and
proceeded on our journey to Columbia, and lodged with our kind
friend William Wright, who, with his worthy and affectionate
wife, entertained us with great hospitality. We had an appointed
meeting at this place the next day. The two following days
we attended meetings at Little York and Newbury. All of
these were favoured opportunities, in which truth was raised
into dominion, and many hearts were humbled and contrited,
and the faithful comforted and made to rejoice together in the
unity of the one spirit, <i>Christ</i>, the only sure foundation, on which
the true Church has been built in all the varied ages of mankind,
from the beginning down to the present time; and on which all
future generations must build, or their building must and will
fall.</p>

<p>On first day, the 13th of 7th month, we attended Friends’
meeting at Warrington, and the two following days the meetings
of Huntington and <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Monallin">Menallen</span>. These were all favoured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403"></a>[Pg 403]</span>
opportunities, in which ability was vouchsafed, by the blessed
Author of all our sure mercies, to preach the gospel to the people
in the simplicity, plainness, and demonstration of the spirit,
which brought a precious solemnity over the assemblies; and I
parted with them with the satisfactory evidence of having faithfully
discharged myself among them, feeling that true peace of
mind, which the world, with all its fading enjoyments, cannot
give nor take away. The next day, the 16th, we proceeded on
our journey through the mountains to Redstone, about one
hundred and sixty-one miles; and arrived there on first day,
the 20th, about eight o’clock in the morning, at the house of
our kind friend Jesse Townsend. We attended their meeting
at the eleventh hour, which was large and favoured. We
lodged with our aforesaid friend, during the time we spent in
this place.</p>

<p>On second day we rested. On third and fourth days we
attended meetings at Providence and Centre. On fifth day we
attended Westland monthly meeting; and the neighbourhood
being informed of our coming, there were more people assembled
than the house could contain; and I had a full opportunity to
discharge myself among them in a large effective testimony,
which brought a precious solemnity over the meeting, and
many minds were humbled and contrited.</p>

<p>A Friend from abroad attended this meeting, and after I sat
down he rose and made opposition, which greatly disturbed the
meeting.</p>

<p>On sixth day we attended an appointed meeting at Pike
Run. It was held in the side of a wood, the meeting-house
having been burnt. There being but few Friends in this place,
they met in a small private room: this induced them to make
seats out of doors, as the house would not have held half the
people that met. It was an unusually favoured season. In the
silent part of the meeting, the divine presence was felt to spread
over the assembly, producing such a sweet and precious solemnity,
as I scarcely ever before witnessed in the same fullness,
and which continued through the course of my communication.
Surely it was the Lord’s doing, and it was marvellous in our eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404"></a>[Pg 404]</span></p>

<p>After this meeting we dined with our kind friend John Grave,
and then proceeded on our way about three miles towards
Brownsville, and lodged with our friend Isaac Walker. On
seventh day night we lodged at the house of our friend Solomon
Philips, near Brownsville; and the next morning crossed the
river Monongahela into the town. Here we put up again with
our kind friends Jesse and Edith Townsend, where we had the
company of many Friends, and many of the inhabitants of the
town not members of our society, also came in to see us; as the
unfounded reports of those who style themselves Orthodox,
having been generally spread over the country, it created such
a great excitement in the minds of the people at large, that multitudes
flocked to the meetings where we were, to hear for themselves;
and many came to see us, and acknowledged their
satisfaction.</p>

<p>At this place we again fell in with the Friend from abroad,
who attended the meeting with us; he rose in the early part
of the meeting, and continued his communication so long, that
a number left the meeting, by which it became very much unsettled:
however, when he sat down I felt an opening to stand
up; and the people returned and crowded into the house, and
those that could not get in stood about the doors and windows,
and a precious solemnity soon spread over the meeting, which
has been the case in every meeting, where our opposers did not
make disturbance by their disorderly conduct. The meeting
closed in a quiet and orderly manner, and I was very thankful
for the favour.</p>

<p>On second day we rested and wrote to our friends. On third
day we attended their preparative meeting for Ministers and
Elders, and on fourth day their monthly meeting. Here the
Friend who had before made opposition opposed me publicly and
personally in the meeting for worship; but I nevertheless had a
favoured opportunity, to the general satisfaction of the meeting,
and to the peace of my own mind.</p>

<p>We attended Westland meeting again on fifth day as it came
in course. It was pretty large, many of the neighbouring inhabitants
coming in. We had a very favoured meeting; Friends<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405"></a>[Pg 405]</span>
were comforted together, and the people went away satisfied;
and my mind was fully relieved, and inspired with thankfulness
and gratitude.</p>

<p>On sixth day we attended the quarterly meeting of Ministers
and Elders held at Westland, where we met with but little opposition;
and the next day we attended the quarterly meeting of
discipline. I had good service in the meeting for worship, which
preceded that for discipline. It was very large, a great number
of those not in membership with Friends came in, and
behaved very orderly. Here we met with some opposition,
more particularly in the meeting for discipline from the Friend
above mentioned. And Friends were so disturbed with the
conduct of this Friend and his companion, that they proposed
that the Elders and Overseers should take an opportunity with
them, and see if they could not put a stop to such disorderly
conduct; accordingly they had an interview with them, in
which Friends relieved their minds pretty fully; but the few
termed Orthodox, used their influence in their favour, which
greatly prevented their being benefited by the opportunity.</p>

<p>Public notice was given at the close of the meeting on seventh
day, that my companion and myself intended to be at their
meeting the next day. A great number more assembled than
the house could contain; and although the Friend above alluded
to, had so fully discovered that not only Friends, but the people
generally, had no unity with him, yet soon after the meeting
was settled, he rose and stood a considerable time. After he
sat down, I was favoured to clear myself among them in a large
impressive testimony, that soon brought a precious solemnity
over the meeting; and many hearts were broken and contrited,
and I took an affectionate farewell of the assembly in the
fresh feelings of gospel love. As I was about to close the meeting,
the same individual again rose, and began to oppose what
had been said by me; this so offended the people, Friends and
others, that they rose up and went out in great numbers, he at
the same time begging them to stay; but they refused and
continued going out until he was discouraged and sat down.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406"></a>[Pg 406]</span>
Soon after I closed the meeting, feeling very sorry for the people
to see them so imposed upon.</p>

<p>After this meeting we proceeded that afternoon about seven
miles, on our way to Pittsburg. On second day we rode to
Pittsburg, and lodged with Robert Townsend; who, although
not in membership with Friends, entertained us with much
kindness and hospitality. The day following at evening, we
had a large satisfactory meeting in their court-house, Friends
having no meeting in that town. On fourth day we proceeded
on our journey, crossing the Alleghany river at Pittsburg, and
arrived that evening at a village, at the great falls of the river
Beaver. The next day we had an appointed meeting there,
held in a field under some trees, which made a comfortable
shade, the weather being very warm, and Friends meeting-house
much too small to contain the people who assembled. It
was a very solemn opportunity, in which truth was raised into
victory over all, and the people appeared thankful for the favour;
and I witnessed the consoling evidence of true peace, in faithfully
discharging my duty among them.</p>

<p>After this favoured meeting, we went forward that afternoon
towards Salem, in order to attend the quarterly meeting at that
place, which opened the next day at the eleventh hour, with a
meeting of Ministers and Elders. Friends met in a school-house
which one of them had built on his own premises, with which,
and a temporary shed that Friends put up adjoining to it, the
meeting was pretty well accommodated. They conducted the
business of the quarterly meeting in much unity and concord,
and the Lord’s presence was evidently felt to cover the assembly.
The next day being first day, and as notice was spread of our
being there, the meeting was very large. It was judged by
Friends that upwards of two thousand people attended. It was
a highly favoured season, in which I was enabled by Him, who
when he opens none can shut, and when he shuts none can
open, to declare the truth to the people in the demonstration of
the spirit, and with a power attending which brought a precious
solemnity over the meeting, and many hearts were humbled
and contrited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407"></a>[Pg 407]</span></p>

<p>The next day we had a meeting by appointment at Fairfield.
This was also a very large meeting, many more assembled than
the house could contain. I had a favoured time among them,
and was made thankful for the opportunity, and had cause to
believe my labour was not in vain.</p>

<p>The day following we attended New Garden quarterly meeting.
Here Friends had a trying time, as those called Orthodox,
although they were but a small part of the meeting, had undertaken
to disown a number of Friends; but Friends did not
acknowledge their authority, nor consider their disownments of
any effect, and they all came together as usual in the quarterly
meeting. The Orthodox strove hard to get Friends to withdraw,
but they refused, and proceeded with the business of the meeting,
which those called Orthodox interrupted for a time; but finding
that Friends would not give way, they finally left the meeting,
and retired to a school-house, and Friends had a comfortable
season together, and conducted their business in much harmony
and condescension, and were evidently owned by the Head of the
Church.</p>

<p>I appointed a meeting on fourth day for the public at large,
Friends, and others. A large number assembled; many more
than the house could contain. We had a precious meeting: the
Lord’s power prevailed in an eminent manner. It was a season
thankfully to be remembered, and was truly an humbling time
among the people.</p>

<p>After this we proceeded to New Lisbon, to attend a meeting
there the next day, which we had previously appointed. It was
held out of doors, there being no house in the town sufficient to
hold the people that Friends apprehended would assemble. Being
aware of this, they erected a booth or shed, by setting up posts,
on which they laid long poles, and covered them with branches
of trees to make a shade, as the weather was very warm. Under
this we had a very large favoured meeting, to the general satisfaction
of the people, and peace of my own mind.</p>

<p>The two following days we attended meetings, by appointment,
at Springfield and Goshen. Those called Orthodox had possession
of the meeting-houses at those places, and refused to admit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408"></a>[Pg 408]</span>
us; but although they could shut us out of the meeting-houses,
yet they could not shut us out from the divine presence, for
this was felt eminently to preside in both these highly favoured
meetings.</p>

<p>The next day, being first day and 17th of 8th month, we
attended Marlborough meeting. It was very large, notice
having been previously given of our intention to be there, so that
hundreds assembled who could not get into the house. I had
an open opportunity among them, to proclaim the everlasting
gospel in the demonstration of the spirit, to the comfort and satisfaction
of this large assembly, except those called Orthodox, who,
when I sat down, made great opposition, which greatly offended
the people.</p>

<p>We then proceeded to Canton, a pretty large country town,
and attended a meeting at the fourth hour in the afternoon, and
notice was publicly given that we were to be there. As there
were no members of our society in the town, the meeting was
held in their court-house. Many of the respectable inhabitants
attended, and information being given to Friends of Kendal, a
small meeting about seven miles distant, most of them attended,
and many other inhabitants of that place came also to the
meeting. We had a favoured opportunity with them, and left
them with peace.</p>

<p>After this we returned to New Garden, and put up with our
kind friend Nathan Galbreath. The next day being the fourth
of the week, we rode to Salem, and attended Friends’ monthly
meeting, in which I was led to stir up Friends to faithfulness, in
support of our religious testimonies, as the eyes of the people were
upon us, watching our movements in this time of trial, Friends
separating from each other, and setting up separate meetings,
which caused a great breach of unity and confusion in most of
our meetings, which a few years previous thereto had been united
together in the bonds of Christian fellowship; but a few individuals
who had gained some influence in society, letting in the
spirit of jealousy, began to accuse some of their friends of promulgating
unsound doctrines, without any just cause for so doing,
by which they greatly disturbed the peace and quiet of society;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409"></a>[Pg 409]</span>
and being encouraged therein by several Friends from England,
who as ministers, had obtained liberty from their friends at home,
to come over on a visit to Friends in this country, they blew up
the fire of discord, until they brought about a division in our
once peaceful society; a small minority of which, in many
places, separated themselves from the body, and set up separate
meetings, assuming the names of the yearly, quarterly, and
monthly meetings; and these, in their presumption, have taken
upon them to deal with and disown the great body of the
society.</p>

<p>The next day we returned to New Garden and attended
Friends’ monthly meeting there; and the neighbouring inhabitants
being apprized of our return, a great number came in, and
greatly enlarged the meeting; and He that openeth, and none
can shut, graciously condescended to open my mouth among
them, in a large effective testimony to the truths of the gospel;
and many hearts were humbled and contrited. It appeared as a
renewed visitation of the heavenly Father’s love to Friends and
others; and it was a season gratefully to be remembered by all
present; for surely it was the Lord’s doing, and marvellous in
our eyes.</p>

<p>The day following we had an appointed meeting at Sandy
Spring, at the fourth hour in the afternoon. The meeting
was very large, and favoured with the overshadowing wing
of divine kindness; and a precious solemnity pervaded the
assembly, and my mind was opened to declare the truth to
them, to the apparent satisfaction and comfort of the assembled
multitude; and I took leave of them with thankfulness and
peace of mind. We remained here until the next morning,
and then proceeded on our journey to Richmond, about thirty-five
miles, where we took up our lodging at an inn. The next
day being first day, and 24th of 8th month, we had an appointed
meeting in the town. The inhabitants were mostly Presbyterians
and Methodists. It was held in their school-house, a
large convenient room. The people came in freely, and behaved
with great propriety and order, and appeared to go away satis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410"></a>[Pg 410]</span>fied;
and I felt true peace in having faithfully, in gospel love,
discharged myself among them.</p>

<p>After this we proceeded about five miles on our way to Smithfield,
and the next morning rode to that place; but being somewhat
unwell, we rested there through the day, and the next
day had an appointed meeting there, at the fourth hour in the
afternoon. Those called Orthodox, shut the meeting-house
against us; but Friends provided seats under the shade of
trees, in an adjacent wood, where we had a very solemn,
favoured meeting, in which the Lord’s power prevailed over all
in an eminent degree, and broke down all opposition, and many
hearts were broken and contrited; and we parted with them
under a grateful sense of the Lord’s mercy for the unmerited
favour.</p>

<p>On the 27th of 8th month, 1828, we proceeded on our journey
to Mount Pleasant, and attended on that day, their meeting
in the middle of the week; it was large, by the attendance of
many of the inhabitants who were not members of our society,
and was, in the forepart, a solemn, quiet meeting; but the latter
part of it was disturbed and its usefulness marred, by a long,
tedious communication from a minister among those called Orthodox,
who, after I sat down, publicly opposed and endeavoured
to lay waste what I had said.</p>

<p>The next day we attended Short Creek meeting. Here also
the meeting in the forepart, was truly a solemn season, in which
I was favoured to open and declare many important truths of
the gospel to the people, which brought a precious solemnity
over the assembly, and many minds were contrited; but an
opposition from the same person who caused the disturbance the
day before, again took place, much to the dissatisfaction of the
principal part of those assembled.</p>

<p>The next day being the sixth of the week, we attended an
appointed meeting at Harrisville. Here we met with no interruption.
This was a large crowded meeting, and very solemn
and quiet. I had an open time among the people to declare
many things, both old and new; setting forth the great declension
of the professed Christian Churches, from the simplicity
and integrity of the primitive disciples; and showing that it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_412"></a>[Pg 412]</span>
all brought about by a departure from the only sure foundation
of true and real Christianity, the <i>light within</i>, or <i>spirit of
truth</i>, <i>the immediate revelation of the spirit of God</i>, in the
immortal souls of men and women; the only and alone true
teacher of the things of God under the gospel. And as a departure
from this only sure guide, and turning back to the letter
and external evidence, and building up, from these outward
materials, many diverse systems of religion, in their own creaturely
wisdom, brought confusion and anarchy into the Church,
which enveloped it in a state of midnight darkness and death,
as to the life and spirit of real Christianity; by which the worst of
persecution, and the most cruel and sanguinary wars were introduced
among Christians: so nothing short of a full and entire
return to this only sure foundation and first principle, and placing
an entire dependance thereon for our salvation, can ever produce
a real restoration from the apostate state in which Christendom
is at present involved. I was also led to lay before the people
the inconsistency and hurtful tendency of Bible and Missionary
societies; as believing them all to be set up and associated
together in the will and wisdom of man, which never did, nor
ever can, produce the righteousness of God, but tend to lead the
mind down to a state of darkness and death, as a dependance
on the letter and external evidence ever has, and ever will kill,
as to the real spiritual life, agreeably to Paul’s doctrine: “The
letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.”</p>

<p>The next day we had an appointed meeting at Westgrove.
The day following being the first of the week, and 31st of 8th
month, we attended Concord meeting; and the three following
days attended meetings at St. Clairsville, Plainfield, and
Wrightstown. These were all large satisfactory meetings, in
which the gospel was preached to the people, and by the power
attending, many hearts were broken and contrited; and a precious
sense of the divine presence was felt to preside, to the comfort
and encouragement of the honest-hearted; a sense of which
inspired my mind with thanksgiving and gratitude, to the blessed
Author of all our sure mercies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413"></a>[Pg 413]</span></p>

<p>On fifth day, the 4th of 9th month, we had an appointed
meeting at a place called Stillwater. It was a very large comfortable
meeting, and I had a full opportunity in an effective
testimony, to ease my exercised mind among them, to the comfort
and apparent satisfaction of the people, both Friends and
others. The next day we rode back to Mount Pleasant, and
the day following being the seventh day of the week, and 6th
of 9th month, the yearly meeting opened with a meeting of
Ministers and Elders. When the time came for meeting, Friends
gathered to the gate which led into the yard where the meeting-house
stood, and found it guarded by a number of men of the
opposing party, who refused to let us in; and Friends had to
hold their meeting in the open air, outside of the yard; but after
the first sitting, adjourned to a school-house near by, and afterwards
held the remaining sittings in a private room, in Israel
French’s house.</p>

<p>The next day and first of the week, we attended Mount
Pleasant meeting in the morning, and that held at Short Creek
in the afternoon. In the morning meeting Elisha Bates and
Anna Braithwaite made great opposition, endeavouring by long
and tedious communications to lay waste what I had previously
communicated, which very much disturbed many present. But
the afternoon meeting was not interrupted, as none of those
opposers attended.</p>

<p>On second day morning, the yearly meeting for discipline
opened at the tenth hour. Not being present at this sitting, I
was informed that great confusion and disorder took place; both
Friends and those called Orthodox wished to retain possession
of the meeting-house, and both parties went on with their business
with separate clerks, for some little time, when the Orthodox
adjourned their meeting to ten o’clock the next day, and
left the house in the possession of Friends, who then proceeded
quietly on with the business of the meeting until some time in
the afternoon, and then adjourned to nine o’clock the next day;
when they again met, and near the tenth hour a deputation
from our opposing Friends came and demanded the use of the
house, in the name of the yearly meeting of Ohio. Friends<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_414"></a>[Pg 414]</span>
informed them that the yearly meeting was now sitting, and
the doors were open, and they might come in; and after some
further requisition for Friends to withdraw, and give them the
entire use of the house, which Friends could not think right to do,
as being entirely unreasonable, they then went away and did not
give Friends any more interruption in that way. But they had
recourse to the law and prosecuted a number of Friends, some
in an action for a pretended trespass, for going into their own
meeting-house, and some as rioters; and compelled them to
leave their meeting and go before the magistrates, to answer for
crimes they, without a just cause, had accused them of having
committed. And a considerable number, it was said about
thirty of their own principal members, such as Ministers and
Elders, and other active members, left the sittings of their yearly
meeting, and went to a town twenty miles distant, where they
had compelled a number of Friends to attend, to be tried by the
court then sitting, and were two days absent from the sittings
of their meeting. After this they interrupted Friends no further,
and Friends quietly proceeded with their business, and
closed on sixth day.</p>

<p>We proceeded on our journey next day to Flushing, and the
day after being the first of the week, we attended Friends’
meeting there; and as notice had been given of our intention
to be there, the meeting was very large, more than the house
could contain. At this meeting those styled Orthodox made
great opposition; for as soon as I came near the meeting-house
several of them met me, and desired I would not interrupt the
meeting: and soon after the meeting was gathered, before it
became fully settled, Charles Osborn, an Orthodox minister,
kneeled in supplication and continued on his knees, I believe,
more than an hour. It was truly a distressing scene, and it
greatly disturbed the meeting; and very soon after he took his
seat, he rose and began to preach, and continued for more than
an hour. However, when he sat down, although the meeting was
much wearied with his long and tedious communications, I felt
the necessity of standing up and addressing the people, which
brought a precious solemnity over the meeting; but as soon as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415"></a>[Pg 415]</span>
I sat down, he rose again to contradict, and tried to lay waste
my communication, by asserting that I had not the unity of my
friends at home; which being untrue, I therefore informed the
meeting that I had certificates with me to prove the incorrectness
of his assertions, which I then produced, but he and his
party would not stay to hear them, but in a disorderly manner
arose and left the meeting; but the people generally stayed and
heard them read, to their general satisfaction.</p>

<p>The next day we went to Cambridge, about thirty-seven
miles; and the day following rode to Zanesville, twenty-four
miles, and had an appointed meeting there in the evening, held
in their court-house, a large room, but not sufficient to contain
all the people who assembled. It was a very solemn instructive
opportunity, and I parted with them under a thankful sense of
the favour, and with peace of mind. The two following days
we rode to Wilmington, and put up with our friend Warren
Sabin, where we lodged the two next nights.</p>

<p>On seventh day the 20th of 9th month, we rode to Centre,
and attended Friends’ monthly meeting, composed of the preparative
meetings of Centre and Wilmington. It was the first
monthly meeting they had held since the separation; and notice
being given of our attendance, the meeting for worship was
very large, more than the house could contain; and the Lord,
our never-failing helper manifested his presence, solemnizing
the assembly and opening the minds of the people to receive the
word preached; breaking down all opposition, and humbling
and contriting the assembly in a very general manner; and we
parted from each other with grateful hearts, from an humbling
sense of the unmerited favour.</p>

<p>We returned that evening to Wilmington, and the next day
attended Friends’ meeting in that town; and as their meeting-house
was small, Friends procured the court-house in that place
to hold the meeting in. The meeting was very large, and we
had a very favoured opportunity to declare the truth among
them, to their general satisfaction; and the honest-hearted were
comforted and edified, and Friends were made to rejoice for the
unmerited favour. At the fourth hour in the afternoon, we had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_416"></a>[Pg 416]</span>
an appointed meeting at a place called Lital’s Creek, a short distance
from Wilmington. Here we had a favoured opportunity
with the people, greatly to their satisfaction.</p>

<p>The next day being the second of the week, and 22d of the
month, we proceeded on to Springfield. Here those called
Orthodox shut the meeting-house and set guards at the doors
to keep us out, and we held our meeting under some trees near
by. It was a precious season, wherein the Lord’s power and
love were exalted over all opposition, and many minds were
humbled and contrited; and thanksgiving and praise were
ascribed to His great and adorable name, who is over all, blessed
for ever.</p>

<p>We had a favoured meeting the day after, at a place called
the Grove. Friends’ meeting-house there being small, we had
to hold the meeting out of doors to accommodate the people. It
was a very satisfactory opportunity. The following day we had
an appointed meeting at Lebanon, a pretty large country town,
where there were no members of our society, but many sober
people. It was held in the court-house, but it was not sufficient
to contain the people; about one third of those who assembled
had to stand out of doors. It was an instructive opportunity;
many gospel truths were opened to the people, and they
appeared to go away well satisfied; and I parted from them
with true peace of mind.</p>

<p>On seventh day, the 27th of the month, we attended the
opening of Indiana yearly meeting, with the first sitting of the
meeting of Ministers and Elders; and although small, it was
a favoured encouraging opportunity to the few who assembled.
The next day, being first day, a large concourse assembled with
Friends. A great number had to stand without, although the
house was very large. And he that openeth and none can shut,
and when he shutteth none can open, opened my mouth among
them in a large effective testimony to the truths of the gospel;
in which, through adorable condescension, I was enabled to
bring forth, out of the Lord’s treasury, things new and old; and
truth was raised into dominion over all, to the comfort and
rejoicing of the honest-hearted, and to the apparent satisfaction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417"></a>[Pg 417]</span>
and edification of the people in general. Surely it was the
Lord’s doing, and it was marvellous in our eyes. The next day
the meeting for discipline opened, and continued by adjournments
until sixth day evening; and Friends were favoured,
through the several sittings, to conduct the business in much
harmony and brotherly condescension.</p>

<p>The day after, we proceeded on our journey towards Richmond,
in Indiana; attending meetings on our way, at Springborough,
Elk, Westfield, and Eaton. All these were seasons
of favour, the Lord graciously manifesting his presence for our
help. Blessed be his great and excellent name, for his mercy
endureth for ever.</p>

<p>From Eaton we rode home with our kind friends John and
Elizabeth Barnes, and lodged. The next day, being the fourth
of the week, and 8th of 10th month, we rode to Richmond,
where those called Orthodox were holding their yearly meeting;
and as this day was the time for holding a meeting for worship,
notice was given of our intention of being there. It was very
large, and proved, through adorable condescension, a solemn
heart-tendering season, in which truth reigned over all.</p>

<p>The three following days we attended meetings by our appointment,
at Centreville, West Union and Milford. After this
we returned again to Richmond, in order, agreeably to appointment,
to attend their first day meeting. It was large like the
former; a multitude of people assembled; and was a precious
meeting, in which truth was triumphant, and ran as oil over
the assembly, breaking down all opposition, and melting a
great portion of the assembly into tears of contrition. Surely
it was the Lord’s doing, and marvellous in our eyes; and to him
belongeth all the praise, who is over all, blessed for ever.</p>

<p>We parted from them with solid satisfaction, and peace of
mind; and after dinner took a solemn and very affectionate
leave of our friends, and rode on our journey about four miles,
and spent the evening at the house of our esteemed friend
Benjamin Stokes. We returned and lodged with our kind
friend John Barnes; and the following day attended a meeting,
by our appointment, at a place called the Ridge; it was a com<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418"></a>[Pg 418]</span>fortable
opportunity. The next day we attended a meeting at
Orange. Here those called Orthodox made great disturbance,
and hurt the meeting very considerably. The day after, we
had a meeting at a place called Silver Creek. This was a
precious meeting, in which truth reigned over all.</p>

<p>We then proceeded on our journey towards Cincinnati, and
arrived there on seventh day, the 18th of 10th month. The
next day being first day, we attended Friends’ meeting at that
place, at the usual time, which was very large, many more
attending than the house could contain: and at three o’clock in
the afternoon, we appointed a meeting to be held in the court-house.
Both these meetings were highly favoured seasons, in
which truth was raised into dominion over all opposition, to the
praise of Him, who is calling us to glory and to virtue.</p>

<p>On second day morning we proceeded on our journey, towards
home; and attending meetings in our way, in the course of the
week, at Salt Creek, Salem, alias Rochester, Newberry, and Clear
Creek. All these meetings were composed of people of varied professions,
to whom the gospel was preached in the demonstration
of the spirit, attended with a power which silenced all opposition,
humbling and contriting many hearts, without respect of persons
or sects; and Friends were comforted together, and made
to rejoice for the unmerited favour; and we parted from them
under a thankful sense of the Lord’s mercy, and with peace of
mind.</p>

<p>The next day being first day, and 26th of 10th month, we
attended Fairfield meeting; and notice being given of our
intention of attending it, the meeting was very large. Here
those called Orthodox made public opposition in the early part
of the meeting; one of them informing the assembly that I was
travelling without having the unity of my Friends, and other
incorrect declarations, which I passed over without notice at the
time. The meeting was soon gathered into a solemn quiet, and
I had a favoured opportunity to declare the truth among them,
which was raised into dominion, and many hearts were humbled
and contrited. Before, however, I had concluded my
communication, those called Orthodox, to manifest further dis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419"></a>[Pg 419]</span>unity,
rose and left the meeting; but Friends and others kept
their seats, and we had a very solemn close, and great brokenness
and contrition were manifest among the people; and to
do away the false reports spread by the Orthodox, I had my certificates
read, which gave full satisfaction to the assembly; and
we took an affectionate farewell of our friends and others present.</p>

<p>We then proceeded on our journey to Wheeling in Virginia, a
town situated on the east side of Ohio river. We arrived here
on sixth day, the 31st, a little before noon, and had an appointed
meeting in the evening. As Friends have no meeting-house in
this place, it was held in the Methodist meeting-house, which
they kindly offered of their own accord. It was a pretty large
collection of people, mostly made up of other societies, the number
of Friends there being very small, insomuch that they have
no steady meeting in the place. It was a comfortable, favoured
opportunity.</p>

<p>We left them with peace of mind, and proceeded on our journey
to Westland, in the limits of Redstone quarterly meeting,
where we arrived on first day, the 2d of 11th month, in time to
attend their meeting. It was a very solemn edifying opportunity,
in which the power of truth was exalted over all opposition.
After this we proceeded on to Redstone, about seven miles, crossing
the Monongahela river in the way; and the next day had
an appointed meeting in that town, at two o’clock in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The day after we passed on towards Waterford, alias Fairfax,
in Virginia, where we arrived on first day the 9th of 11th month,
and attended their meeting at the usual hour. At two o’clock
in the afternoon, we had an appointed meeting for the inhabitants
of the town in general; and the two following days attended
meetings, by appointment, at Goose Creek and Southwest Fork.
These were all large favoured meetings, particularly the two last,
wherein I was led to expose the great evil of oppression, especially
that enormous sin of holding our fellow creatures in slavery.
Although in my communication I was led to lay judgment to
the line, and justice to the plumb line; yet the slave-holders,
divers of whom were present, were so brought down and humbled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_420"></a>[Pg 420]</span>
with the force and correctness of the testimony, that they frankly
acknowledged the truth and propriety of it; and we parted from
them with true peace of mind, and the honest-hearted were made
to rejoice for the favour dispensed from the hand of the gracious
Benefactor of every blessing.</p>

<p>The next day we rode to Alexandria, forty-three miles, and
lodged with our kind friend Phineas Janney, and the day after
attended their meeting as it came in course, and in the evening
had another meeting for the inhabitants of the town in general.
These were opportunities of favour: many truths of the gospel
were set forth before the people, in the demonstration of the
spirit, which brought a solemnity over the assembly, to the comfort
and edification of the upright in heart. The next day we
rode to Washington, and attended a meeting there in the evening.
This was rather a trying season in the forepart, but, I
trust, it ended well.</p>

<p>We then proceeded to Sandy Spring, in Maryland, and on
first day, the 16th of 11th month, attended Friends’ meeting
there; and notice being given of our expectation of attending it,
the meeting was large; and through condescending goodness, it
proved to be a very favoured instructive season, and I parted with
them with a thankful heart, and true peace of mind. The next
day we proceeded on our journey to Elk Ridge, and lodged with
our kind friend George Ellicot; and the day following being third
day, we had, by appointment, a very comfortable, favoured meeting
with Friends: many of the neighbouring inhabitants likewise
attended, and appeared well satisfied with the opportunity. Many
minds were humbled and contrited, and a precious solemnity
prevailed over the meeting.</p>

<p>After this meeting we dined at our lodgings, and that afternoon
proceeded in company with our kind friend John Marsh,
who met us at this meeting, six miles on our way to Baltimore,
and lodged at his house. In the morning we rode into the city,
and on that and the following day attended Friends’ meetings
held in the middle of the week, at the upper and lower houses;
and not feeling fully clear, on sixth day evening, we had an
appointed meeting for the inhabitants of the town in general, at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_421"></a>[Pg 421]</span>
the upper house. This was a very large meeting, made up of
almost every class of the people, among whom, as to religious profession,
were Romanists, Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Baptists,
Methodists, Unitarians, and others of divers descriptions, and some
slave-holders. These meetings were seasons of favour, particularly
the last, in which truth in a very extraordinary manner was
raised into victory over all, bowing and breaking down all under
its baptizing influence, so that it appeared as though the whole
assembly were baptized into one body; and when the meeting
closed, all seemed desirous to take me by the hand. Surely it
was the Lord’s doing, and marvellous in mine eyes; and I parted
with them with gratitude and thankfulness of heart.</p>

<p>The day following we rode to Gunpowder Falls; and the
next day being first day, and 23d of the 11th month, we
attended Friends’ meeting there; and information being given
of our intention of attending it, the meeting was large, and
through the condescending goodness of Israel’s unslumbering
Shepherd, whose mercy is over all his works, it proved a precious
favoured opportunity, in which many hearts were humbled and
contrited, and truth was raised into dominion. The day following
we went to the Little Falls, and on third day, the 25th,
attended Friends’ meeting in that place, and the day after
attended Deer Creek meeting. These were very large favoured
opportunities. After this we proceeded on our journey, crossing
the river Susquehannah on our way to Little Britain; and on
the three following days we attended meetings at Little Britain,
West and East Nottingham. These were seasons to be remembered,
in which the Lord’s power was eminently manifested
by its solemnizing influence. Surely it was the Lord’s doing.</p>

<p>On second day, the 1st of 12th month, we proceeded to West
Grove, in Chester county. Here our opposing brethren shut
the meeting-house against us, and the care-taker of it refused
to open it. However, when the people assembled, which they
did in great numbers, many more than the house could contain,
it was opened; and we had a very favoured, solemn opportunity
with them, in which truth reigned over all. The three following
days we attended the monthly meetings of London Grove,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422"></a>[Pg 422]</span>
New Garden, and Fallowfield, as they came in their usual
course; and notice being given, of our attending them, to the
neighbouring inhabitants, great numbers of the varied classes
of the people assembled with Friends; insomuch that none of
the houses were large enough to contain the multitude, and in
some instances there were nearly as many standing without as
the houses contained. These were all highly favoured seasons,
the Lord’s power evidently presiding over these large assemblies,
solemnizing and humbling with its overshadowing influence,
and causing a profound silence to prevail over all, to the praise
of him who is over all, God blessed for ever.</p>

<p>On the two following days we attended meetings at Marlborough
and West Chester. The first was by our appointment,
the latter on first day. These meetings were like the former;
great numbers attended more than the houses could contain:
nevertheless, order and stillness prevailed in a remarkable
manner in and without the houses, in every place, to the comfort
and rejoicing of Friends, and to the instruction and edification,
I trust, of the assembled multitudes. We took leave of them
under an humbling sense of the unmerited favour, and with
true peace of mind.</p>

<p>On second day, the 8th of the month, we attended Kennet
meeting, and on third and fourth days we had meetings at
Kennet Square and Centre. These were all crowded meetings,
and in them all the divine presence was felt to preside, solemnizing
the assemblies, and comforting and rejoicing the honest-hearted.</p>

<p>On fifth and sixth days we attended meetings at Hockesson
and Stanton. Both were crowded, solemn meetings, and, I
trust, instructive and profitable to many who were present. After
the latter, we rode that afternoon to Wilmington, and rested on
seventh day with our friend William Poole, who was in a weak
state from bodily indisposition, but was so far recovered as to
walk about. On first day, the 14th, we attended Friends’
meetings in Wilmington, both forenoon and afternoon. They
were both very large. In the forenoon meeting I had good
service, but in the afternoon I was mostly silent, as the people<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_423"></a>[Pg 423]</span>
appeared to be too much hungering for words, and too indifferent
and careless in putting in practice what they had already heard
and knew to be their duty. Hence I was led to set them an
example of silence.</p>

<p>We left Wilmington on second day morning, and proceeded
to Concord, and attended a meeting there by previous appointment.
The four following days we attended meetings at Middletown,
Providence, Chester, and Darby. These were all very
large favoured opportunities, in which the Lord’s power was
felt to preside, causing a precious solemnity to spread over the
assemblies, and humbling and contriting many minds. To the
Lord be the praise and glory of his own work; nothing due to
man.</p>

<p>Leaving Darby, we proceeded on to Philadelphia; and on
first day, the 21st of 12th month, we attended Friends’ meetings
in the city, that at Cherry-street in the morning, and at Green-street
in the afternoon. At both these meetings hundreds more
assembled than the houses could contain. On second day we
left the city, and attended meetings, in the course of the week,
at Haverford, Radnor, Newtown, Willistown, and the Valley.
All these meetings were unusually large; the houses were
generally too small to contain the people; many had to stand
out of doors for want of room; nevertheless, the people behaved
orderly, and the Lord’s presence was felt to preside, solemnizing
those crowded assemblies, in all of which my mind was opened,
and ability afforded, to preach the gospel to the people in the
demonstration of the spirit and with power, and many hearts
were broken and contrited, and went away rejoicing, under a
thankful sense of the unmerited favour.</p>

<p>After this we returned to the city, and on first day, the 28th
of the month, we again attended Friends’ meetings there, in the
same order as before. On second day we attended Frankfort
meeting by appointment. These were all large favoured meetings;
many had to leave those in the city for want of room.
My opposing brethren had, by their public opposition and erroneous
reports, created such excitement in the minds of the people
generally of every profession, that it induced multitudes to assem<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_424"></a>[Pg 424]</span>ble
to hear for themselves; and they generally went away satisfied
and comforted.</p>

<p>On third day we took leave of our friends in Philadelphia,
and passed over into New Jersey; and the four following days
attended meetings at Mullica Hill, Piles Grove, Salem, and
Woodbury. These were very large favoured meetings; and I
felt true peace of mind as a rich reward for my labour and
exercise among them.</p>

<p>We attended Haddonfield meeting on first day, the 4th of 1st
month, 1829. Here Friends, and those who styled themselves
Orthodox, met together in the same house. As notice was
given of my attendance, the people assembled in great numbers;
and as soon as the meeting was fully gathered, a precious
solemnity was felt to spread over the assembly; and the Lord,
our gracious helper, was near for our support and strength, and
the truth was raised triumphantly over all opposition.</p>

<p>The four following days we attended meetings at Moore’s
Town, Evesham, Cropwell, Mount Holly, and Upper Evesham.
These were very large meetings, in which the Lord our gracious
helper made bare his arm for our support, enabling to hand forth
out of the treasury things new and old, to the comfort and edification
of the honest-hearted, and solid peace of my own mind;
to Him be all the praise, nothing due to man.</p>

<p>On first day the 11th, we attended Friends’ meeting at <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Rancocus">Rancocas</span>.
This was said to be the largest meeting ever known in
that place; in which the Lord’s presence was felt to preside,
humbling and contriting many minds, and baptizing the whole
assembly into a very precious solemnity; and causing the
upright in heart to rejoice, under a thankful sense of the
unmerited favour.</p>

<p>In the course of this week we attended meetings at Old
Springfield on second day, Mansfield on third day, Upper Springfield
on fourth day, Arney’s Town on fifth day, Crosswicks,
alias Chesterfield on sixth day, Bordentown on seventh day,
and Trenton on first day. All these were favoured opportunities,
and in them all, although under considerable indisposition
of body, I was favoured with strength, and way opened to labour<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_425"></a>[Pg 425]</span>
in the Lord’s cause in which I was engaged, and which produced
that true peace of mind, that the world with all its perishing
enjoyments cannot give, nor all its frowns and opposition
take away.</p>

<p>On second day we proceeded on our journey towards New-York,
being desirous of reaching our quarterly meeting to be
held there on the following fifth day. We arrived in the city
on third day afternoon, where I met my beloved wife and
daughter Elizabeth, and several other branches of my family,
and a number more of my near and intimate friends. It was
truly a season of mutual rejoicing, and my spirit was deeply
humbled under a thankful sense of the Lord’s preserving power
and adorable mercy, in carrying me through and over all opposition,
both within and without. He caused all to work together
for good, and the promotion of his own glorious cause of truth
and righteousness in the earth, and landed me safe in the bosom
of my dear family and friends at home, and clothed my spirit with
the reward of sweet peace for all my labour and travail. Praises,
everlasting high praises, be ascribed unto our God, for his mercy
endureth for ever.</p>

<p>On seventh day, after the quarterly meeting we returned
home, having been out on this journey seven months and ten
days, and travelled nearly twenty-four hundred miles.</p>

<p>Soon after my return from the aforesaid journey, I had to experience
a very severe trial and affliction in the removal of my
dearly beloved wife. She was taken down with a cold, and
although, for a number of days, we had no anticipation of danger
from her complaint, yet about five days after she was taken,
the disorder appeared to settle on her lungs, and it brought on
an inflammation which terminated in a dissolution of her precious
life, on the ninth day from the time she was taken ill.
She had but little bodily pain, yet as she became weaker, she
suffered from shortness of breathing; but before her close, she
became perfectly tranquil and easy, and passed away like a lamb,
as though entering into a sweet sleep, without sigh or groan, or
the least bodily pain, on the 17th of 3d month, 1829: And her
precious spirit, I trust and believe, has landed safely on the an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426"></a>[Pg 426]</span>gelic
shore, “where the wicked cease from troubling, and the
weary are at rest.” To myself, to whom she was a truly affectionate
wife, and to our children, whom she endeavoured, by
precept and example, to train up in the paths of virtue, and to
guard and keep out of harm’s way, her removal is a great
and irreparable loss: and nothing is left to us in that behalf,
but a confident belief, and an unshaken hope, that our great
loss is her still greater gain; and although the loss and trial as
to all my external blessings, are the greatest I have ever met
with, or ever expect to have to endure, yet I have a hope, that,
though separated, I may be preserved from mourning or complaining;
and that I may continually keep in view the unmerited
favour dispensed to us, by being preserved together fifty-eight
years in one unbroken bond of endeared affection, which seemed
if possible to increase with time to the last moment of her life;
and which neither time nor distance can lessen or dissolve; but
in the spiritual relation I trust it will endure for ever, where all
the Lord’s redeemed children are one in him, who is God over
all, in all, and through all, blessed for ever. She was buried
on the 19th, and on this solemn occasion, the Lord, who is
strength in weakness, enabled me to bear a public, and I trust a
profitable testimony, to the virtues and excellences of her long
and consistent life.</p>

<p>On the 24th of 6th month, 1829, I again left home with
Cornwell Willis for my companion, to complete the visit to
Friends and others in the compass of our yearly meeting, agreeably
to a certificate I received from our monthly and quarterly
meetings, expressive of their unity with me therein. This certificate
I received in the spring of the year 1828, expressive of
my concern to pay a religious visit to Friends and others, in parts
of the yearly meetings of Philadelphia, Baltimore, Virginia,
Ohio, Indiana, and New-York. I accomplished my visit to the
first four last season; that is, I visited parts of them, but found
my mind released without going into the yearly meeting of
Virginia.</p>

<p>Since I left home, we have attended meetings at Flushing,
Newtown, Brooklyn, and two at New-York last first day. These<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_427"></a>[Pg 427]</span>
were favoured comforting opportunities, affording encouragement
to persevere in the path of duty.</p>

<p>We left New-York on second day the 29th, after taking an
affectionate farewell of our friends there, and proceeded to West
Chester, and attended a meeting at that place at the eleventh
hour; and on the two following days, attended meetings at
Mamaroneck and Purchase. On fifth day we attended Friends’
meeting at Middlesex; and on sixth and seventh days, had
meetings appointed for us at a place called the Saw Pits, and at
Friends’ meeting-house at North Castle. All these meetings
were seasons of favour, in which the divine presence was felt to
preside, solemnizing the assemblies, and affording ability to
minister to the people in gospel authority, and tendering and
contriting many hearts. To the Lord be all the praise, nothing
due to man.</p>

<p>On first day, the 5th of 7th month, we attended Shapaqua
meeting in the morning, and had an appointed meeting at
Croton Valley, at the fourth hour in the afternoon. The three
following days we attended meetings by appointment at Amawalk,
Salem, and at the Valley, called Haviland’s Hollow.
These were all unusually large meetings, in which truth reigned
over all, to the praise of His great name, who giveth us the
victory. From the latter meeting we proceeded to Oblong, and
put up with our kind friend Daniel Merritt, and the next day
attended their meeting. The two following days we had meetings
by our appointment at the Branch, and Poughquague;
and on first day attended Nine Partners meeting. Those four
meetings were unusually large, and very solemn opportunities;
in which truth’s testimony went forth freely, tendering and
contriting many hearts, and rejoicing the faithful travellers
Zion-ward.</p>

<p>The two following days, we had meetings at Chestnut Ridge
and Oswego. These were likewise large satisfactory meetings.
We then proceeded by the way of Poughkeepsie, to Marlborough,
in order to attend Cornwall quarterly meeting, held at Marlborough
at this time. It opened on fourth day, the 15th of 7th
month, with a meeting of Ministers and Elders. The next day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_428"></a>[Pg 428]</span>
the meeting for discipline was held. Both were very favoured
seasons. As I did not feel easy to leave the place without
having a public opportunity with the people at large in that
neighbourhood, a meeting was appointed the next day. This
was likewise a large favoured opportunity. The following
day being seventh day, we returned to Poughkeepsie, in order
to attend Friends’ meeting on first day; and having also
appointed a meeting to be held there, at the fifth hour in the
afternoon, for the inhabitants of the town at large. These
meetings were largely attended, in which the power of truth
was exalted over all.</p>

<p>The four following days we attended meetings at West
Branch, Pleasant Valley, Creek, and Crum-elbow. Although
it was in the midst of harvest, such was the excitement produced
amongst the people by the opposition made by those of our
members who had gone off from us, and set up separate meetings,
that the people at large of other societies flocked to those
meetings in such numbers, that our meeting-houses were seldom
large enough to contain the assembled multitude; and we had
abundant cause for thanksgiving and gratitude to the blessed
Author of all our mercies, in condescending to manifest his holy
presence, and causing it so to preside as to produce a general
solemnity, tendering and contriting many minds, and comforting
and rejoicing the upright in heart.</p>

<p>After the last mentioned meeting we proceeded on our journey,
attending meetings at Stanford, Milan, and on first day the
26th of 7th month, the forenoon and afternoon meetings at
Hudson. On second day we rested, on third day attended a
meeting at Athens, on fourth day at Ghent, on fifth day at
Chatham, on sixth day at Nassau, and on seventh day evening
we had a large meeting in Albany, held in their state-house,
generally composed of people of other professions and inhabitants
of the town, who behaved themselves very soberly, becoming
the occasion. It was a solemn, and, I trust, a profitable opportunity,
in which truth was raised into dominion; and which
in like manner was witnessed in all the foregoing meetings, the
people coming together very freely and in great numbers, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_429"></a>[Pg 429]</span>
a general solemnity prevailed over the assemblies from meeting
to meeting. Surely it was the Lord’s doing, and it was marvellous
in our eyes; witnessing that he had not left himself without
an evidence of the truth in each mind, by which their
understandings were opened to receive, and many of them to
bear testimony to the doctrines delivered in those large solemn
meetings.</p>

<p>From Albany we proceeded on first day morning, the 2d of
8th month, to Troy, and attended their forenoon and afternoon
meetings. These were very large meetings. The first was
held in Friends’ meeting-house, but great numbers collected
more than the house could contain: this induced Friends to
accept the offer of a house belonging to the Episcopalians, which
was not occupied, for the accommodation of the afternoon meeting.
They gave the citizens an invitation to attend; and
although it was a very large building, yet it did not contain the
people who assembled, many had to go away for want of room.
This was likewise a highly favoured opportunity, in which truth
reigned to the comfort and edification of the upright in heart,
and to the general satisfaction of the assembled multitude. It
was, in the estimation of Friends, the largest meeting which
had ever been assembled on any occasion before in that city.</p>

<p>On second day we had an appointed meeting at Greenbush,
a village on the east side of the river, opposite Albany. After
this we proceeded on our journey about eleven miles to the town
of Bethlehem, southwesterly from Albany. Here we lodged
with our kind friend Thomas Rushmore, and attended a meeting
in his house by appointment, on third day; the few Friends
of that place were privileged with holding a meeting for worship
in this <span class="correction" title="In the original book: Friends’">Friend’s</span> house. On fourth day we attended Friends’
meeting at Stanton Hill; and the three following days attended
meetings at New Baltimore, Rensselaerville, and Oak Hill.
These were all large satisfactory meetings.</p>

<p>On first day we were at Bern meeting in the morning; and at
the fourth hour in the afternoon had an appointed meeting at
a village called Rensselaerville City, which was held in a large
meeting-house belonging to the Methodist society. These were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_430"></a>[Pg 430]</span>
very large favoured meetings, in which the truths of the gospel
went forth freely to the people, and appeared to be gladly and
satisfactorily received by them; and I took leave of them with
true peace of mind. On second day we had an appointed meeting
at Middleburgh, much to our satisfaction. It was a very solemn
instructive opportunity, and the people appeared to receive the
word preached with much readiness of mind, and we left them
with thankful hearts.</p>

<p>We proceeded on third day to Duanesburgh, in order to attend
their quarterly meeting, which opened there the next day with
a meeting of Ministers and Elders, and was a favoured opportunity.
The meeting for discipline was large, and the business
conducted in much harmony and condescension; and the public
meeting the next day was very large; hundreds had to stand
out of doors for want of room; and it was a highly favoured
season, worthy of grateful remembrance.</p>

<p>From thence we proceeded to Charleston, and attended
Friends’ meeting there on first day, the 16th of 8th month. This
was likewise a very large meeting, the largest, Friends said, that
had ever been known there before. It was judged, that as many
stood without for want of room, as the house contained; and it
was a very solemn time, both within and without the doors.
The divine canopy was felt to spread over the whole assembly,
and we took leave of them with true peace of mind and thankfulness
of heart, under a grateful sense of the unmerited favour.</p>

<p>On second day we rode to Utica; and the next day had an
appointed meeting there at the eleventh hour. After this we
proceeded to Bridgewater, and attended their fourth day meeting.
These were not so large as in some other places, neither was
there as much openness to receive our testimony as had generally
been the case elsewhere. Our opposing Friends had filled their
heads with so many strange reports, to which they had given
credit without examination, by which their minds were so
strongly prejudiced against me, that many in the compass of
these two last meetings, were not willing to see me, nor hear
any reasons given to show them their mistakes, and that the
reports they had heard were altogether unfounded: however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_431"></a>[Pg 431]</span>
I was favoured to communicate the truth to those who attended,
so that they generally went away fully satisfied, and I left them
with peace of mind.</p>

<p>From this place we proceeded to Deruyter, having a meeting
at Smyrna, on sixth day, in our way. On first day we attended
Friends’ meeting at Deruyter in the morning, and at the fifth
hour in the afternoon had an appointed meeting in Deruyter
village for the inhabitants generally, which was held in the
Baptist meeting-house. These two meetings were very large,
and they were highly favoured opportunities, in which truth
was raised into dominion over all opposition; and we parted
from them with true peace of mind, a rich reward for a faithful
discharge of duty.</p>

<p>The next day, the 24th of 8th month, we proceeded to Sempronius,
having a meeting by previous appointment on our way,
in the town of Homer, at the eleventh hour. It was held in a
large meeting-house belonging to the Methodist society, which
they freely offered for the accommodation of the people, there
being no Friends in the place. A very considerable number of
the inhabitants attended, and behaved soberly, giving good
attention to what was communicated, and went away apparently
satisfied; and we parted with them under an humbling sense
that the appointment, and our labour and service in this meeting,
were owned by the Head of the Church. We arrived at
Sempronius about sunset, and had an appointed meeting there
the next day, held in Friends’ meeting-house at the third hour
in the afternoon. This was likewise a favoured opportunity, in
which the power of truth went forth freely, humbling and contriting
many minds.</p>

<p>After this we proceeded to Skeneateles, and put up with our
kind friend William Willets, and rested here the next day. On
fifth day we attended Friends’ meeting at this place, as it came
in course; and notice being given of our intention of attending
it, the meeting was large. This was a very comforting satisfactory
opportunity, apparently so to all present, although composed
of many of the members of the varied societies of professed Christians
common in our land, and divers of their ministers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_432"></a>[Pg 432]</span></p>

<p>On sixth day we had an appointed meeting in the town of
Auburn, at the third hour in the afternoon; and on seventh day,
an appointed meeting at North-street, in Scipio. These meetings
were largely attended, and, I trust, instructive profitable opportunities
to many who were there. After the latter meeting, we
visited several families of Friends, and took lodgings with our
kind friend John Merritt.</p>

<p>The next day being the first of the week, and 30th of 8th
month, we attended the meeting at South-street. The three
following days we had meetings, by appointment, at Salmon
Creek, Aurora, and Union Springs. These were all very large
favoured meetings, in which the power of truth went forth freely,
and appeared to have a ready entrance into the minds of the
people in a very general manner, bringing a very comfortable
solemnity over these large assemblies; and we took leave of
them with thankful hearts and in true peace of mind.</p>

<p>We then proceeded on our journey to Junius, crossing Cayuga
lake on the way. Here we had a meeting the next day, the
fifth of the week, and 3d of 9th month; and the day following
had an appointed meeting at Galen. These were highly favoured
opportunities, in which the Lord’s presence was felt to preside,
reducing the assemblies into a very solemn state, and truth was
raised into dominion over all, to the comfort and establishment of
Friends on the ancient foundation, <i>the light within</i>; by the
power and efficacy of which, our primitive worthies were gathered
to be a people, from among the varied societies of professed Christians.
For they were settled on that unshaken rock, which
Jesus told his disciples he would build his Church upon, viz: the
revelation of his heavenly Father, against which the gates of
hell should never be able to prevail; and although the powers
of the earth rose up against them, and used all their power and
policy, both priests and people, to overthrow them, yet they were
never permitted to prevail; for the Lord Jehovah, on whose
almighty arm they had placed their entire trust and confidence
for support and defence, delivered them from all their tribulations,
and set them above their persecutors, and caused them to rejoice
on the banks of deliverance. And he is the same God of power<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_433"></a>[Pg 433]</span>
that he ever was, and a present helper in every needful time;
and although many in the present day, who have left their first
love, are rising up, and charging their fellow-professors with
holding unsound doctrines, and are endeavouring, by unfounded
and reproachful epithets, to destroy and undermine their religious
and moral character among men, and have separated from their
brethren, and set up separate meetings, giving them the names
of the meetings of Friends; and in their usurped authority undertake
to disown their fellow-members, who could not submit to
their usurpation: yet all their formal disownments being altogether
out of the order of the gospel, our meetings consider them
of no effect.</p>

<p>From Galen we proceeded to South Farmington, and attended
a meeting there on seventh day, at the third hour in the afternoon;
and the next day being first day, we attended North
Farmington meeting. The three following days we had meetings
at Macedon, Palmyra, and Williamson. These were likewise
large favoured meetings, in which truth was exalted over
all, and we parted with them in true peace of mind, and proceeded
on our journey to Rochester, and had a meeting on sixth
day, by appointment: we also staid and attended their meeting
on first day.</p>

<p>After this we proceeded to Wheatland, and had an appointed
meeting there on second day, the 14th of 9th month; on third
day we were at Henrietta, and on fourth day at Mendon.
These were all favoured opportunities; the people’s minds
seemed to be open to receive us and our testimony with gladness.
From this place we turned back through Farmington
and Scipio, to Skeneateles, and attended a meeting by our
appointment at a village about five miles from the village of
Skeneateles, on the east side of the lake. On first day we
attended Friends’ meeting at Skeneateles; on second day we
proceeded to Verona; and the next day had a meeting there,
held in a meeting-house occupied by the Baptists, Friends’
meeting-house being too small to contain the people who assembled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_434"></a>[Pg 434]</span></p>

<p>The next day being fourth day, we proceeded to Utica, and
had an appointed meeting in the evening. Here we remained
over the next day, and attended Friends’ meeting as it came in
course. From this place we proceeded to Charleston, and
attended their meeting on first day. These meetings, in like
manner, were all solemn seasons; and, I trust, profitable and
comfortable to many; and I left them with peace of mind.
After the last meeting, we rode about thirteen miles, and lodged
with our kind friend Zacheus Mead. The following day we
proceeded on our journey to Newtown; and the next day attended
Friends’ meeting there. After this we proceeded to Saratoga,
and attended Friends’ preparative meeting at that place; and
not feeling clear to leave it, we had an appointed meeting there
the day after, of which public notice was given. It was very
large; and it proved a highly favoured season; the Lord’s
presence was manifested for our help, and truth was raised into
dominion, and ran like oil over the assembly. Many hearts
were broken and contrited, and the upright in heart were made
to rejoice for the unmerited favour.</p>

<p>The following day we had an appointed meeting at Milton.
After this we proceeded to Galway, and lodged with our ancient
friend Philip Macomber, who was in the ninety-first year of his
age. Here we had a meeting on seventh day. The next day,
the 4th of 10th month, we attended Providence meeting, which
was very large. On second day we had an appointed meeting
at Mayfield. These were all seasons of favour, particularly that
at Providence, in which truth was exalted over all opposition,
and many hearts were contrited; from a sense of which, our
minds were bowed in reverence and humiliation before Him,
who is the author of all our sure mercies.</p>

<p>We proceeded from Mayfield to Greenfield, and on fourth day
attended Friends’ monthly meeting at that place, which was
composed of that and Milton preparative meetings. We had good
satisfaction in sitting with our Friends, and in observing their
commendable order, and the harmony and condescension manifest
in conducting the affairs of the Church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_435"></a>[Pg 435]</span></p>

<p>From thence we proceeded to Easton, and had an appointed
meeting there on sixth day. On seventh day we were at Cambridge,
on first day at White Creek, and on second day we rode
to Danby, and the next day had a meeting there. These were
all large and very solemn seasons, in which the great Head of
the Church manifested his gracious presence, convicting and
contriting many minds, and the upright in heart were edified.
From Danby we proceeded to Granville, and had an appointed
meeting there the next day, which was a large solemn opportunity.
The day after we proceeded on our journey to Shoram,
a town on the eastern shore of Lake Champlain. Here we had a
meeting the next day with the few Friends of that place, and
some of the neighbouring inhabitants. It was a comfortable
opportunity, and we left them with peace of mind. We then
rode to Ferrisburgh, and on first day, the 18th of 10th month,
had a very large favoured meeting at that place. On second
day we had an appointed meeting at Monkton. This was likewise
a large favoured opportunity, in which truth reigned over
all opposition, to the praise of his own excellent name, who is
over all, God blessed for ever.</p>

<p>As I was somewhat unwell, we rested on third day with our
kind friends Thomas and Rowland T. Robinson; and feeling
my mind now clear from any further service in these parts, on
fourth day we turned our faces homewards, and proceeded back
to Shoram. On fifth day we had an appointed meeting in that
village, principally for those not members of our society. Although
the people came together in a negligent manner as respected the
appointed time, yet they generally behaved orderly, and appeared
to give good attention to what they heard; and my mouth was
opened by Him who opens and none can shut, in a large effective
testimony to the truths of the gospel; which brought a precious
solemnity over the assembly, and they appeared to go
away satisfied, and we left them with the answer of peace in
our own minds.</p>

<p>The next day we proceeded on our journey to Granville, and
from thence the following day to Queensbury. On first day,
the 25th of 10th month, we attended Friends’ meeting there;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_436"></a>[Pg 436]</span>
and notice being given to the neighbouring inhabitants of our
attendance, they came in until the house was filled, and a number
had to stand without for want of room; and a blessed meeting
we had, in which the power of truth ran as oil over the
assembly, tendering and contriting many minds, and to the
comfort and rejoicing of the upright in heart.</p>

<p>We had an appointed meeting on the following day at Moreau,
which was a large favoured meeting. From thence we
proceeded to Saratoga, and lodged with our kind friend Thomas
Wilbur, and the next day Thomas accompanied us to Pittstown,
where we had an appointed meeting on fourth day. This
was truly an humbling season, in which truth was exalted over
all; great brokenness and contrition of spirit were manifested
among the people, and we were edified together in love, which
inspired our minds with thanksgiving and gratitude for the
unmerited favour.</p>

<p>From this place we proceeded to Troy, and as I was somewhat
unwell, we rested the following day with our kind friend
Isaac Merritt. On sixth day we proceeded on our journey to
the neighbourhood of Hudson, and put up with our kind friend
Thomas Wright; and seventh day being very rainy and
inclement we continued here, and attended Hudson meeting on
first day, which was a large satisfactory meeting.</p>

<p>On second day we proceeded on our journey to Stanford, and
lodged with our kind friend John Hull. The two following
days we attended the quarterly meeting at Nine Partners. At
this place there is a very large body of Friends united together
in gospel fellowship, and they were favoured to conduct the business
of the quarterly meeting in harmony and condescension.
The public meeting was very large. It was attended by a great
number who were not in membership with us, and who behaved
orderly, and it was indeed a very solemn edifying season.</p>

<p>After the close of this meeting, we returned that evening to
Stanford, in order to attend the quarterly meeting at that place,
which opened the next day with a meeting of Ministers and
Elders. I attended this, and the following day, the meeting for
discipline. A large number of the neighbouring inhabitants<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_437"></a>[Pg 437]</span>
attended this meeting, and sat with Friends, until the partition
between the men and women was closed. They behaved very
orderly, and a precious solemnity spread over the assembly, and
many essential doctrines of the gospel were opened to the
people in the demonstration of the spirit, truth was raised into
victory over all, and the upright in heart were edified and
comforted. The meeting of Ministers and Elders was likewise
a precious opportunity, in which comfort and encouragement
were freely administered to them.</p>

<p>From Stanford we proceeded on our journey to Cornwall,
crossing the Hudson river on our way. We arrived here on
seventh day evening, and attended their meeting on first day,
the 8th of 11th month. This meeting was large, and a truly
baptizing season, in which many hearts were humbled and
contrited, and truth reigned over all; thanks be to God, who
giveth us the victory, nothing due to man.</p>

<p>The two following days we had meetings appointed at the
Lower and Upper Clove. These were well attended, and, I
trust, profitable edifying seasons to many present. They were
composed of people of various professions, conditions, and states;
yet all appeared to be brought down and subjected by the
solemnizing influence and power of truth, that reigned victoriously
over all. Surely it was the Lord’s doing, and
it was marvellous in our eyes. These meetings closed my
labour and exercise in the gospel, to Friends and others in the
yearly meetings of Philadelphia, Baltimore, Ohio, Indiana, and
New-York, as expressed in a certificate of unity and concurrence,
given me by the monthly meeting of Jericho, and quarterly
meeting of Westbury.</p>

<p>From the latter meeting we proceeded the next day directly
to New-York, where we arrived on fourth day evening. The
day after we attended Friends’ meeting at Hester-street, it being
their usual meeting day; and a marriage being accomplished
at the close of it, it was larger than usual, as many of the
neighbouring inhabitants attended. Way opened for me to
declare the truth among them, to the peace of my own mind, and
to the mutual comfort and encouragement of the upright in heart.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_438"></a>[Pg 438]</span>
I rested here until first day, and attended Friends’ meeting at
Rose-street in the morning, and that held at Hester-street in the
afternoon. They were both very large solemn meetings. On
second day evening I had an appointed meeting at Brooklyn,
likewise a large and very favoured season. In all of these meetings
the word preached had free course, and I had, in the openings
of truth, to declare to these large mixed assemblages many things
concerning the kingdom of God; and the only sure way by
which an admittance into his kingdom of peace and joy may be
obtained by the children of men.</p>

<p>The foregoing meetings were times of favour, and as a seal
from the hand of our gracious and never-failing Helper, to the
labour and travail which he has led me into, and enabled me
to perform, for the promotion of his great and noble cause of
truth and righteousness in the earth, as set forth in the foregoing
account, and not suffering any weapon formed against me to
prosper. “This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and
their righteousness is of me, saith the Lord.” For all these
unmerited favours and mercies, in deep humiliation my soul
doth magnify the Lord, and return thanksgiving and glory to
his great and excellent name; for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>

<p>On third day we proceeded homeward, and attended Westbury
monthly meeting on fourth day, on our way. After this I rode
home, and found my family well, to our mutual rejoicing; and
we greeted each other with thankful hearts for the unmerited
favour.</p>

<p>We travelled in this journey nearly fifteen hundred miles.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="APPENDIX">APPENDIX.</h2>


<p class="center">LETTER TO HUGH JUDGE, OF OHIO.</p>

<p class="right">
<i>Jericho, 2d mo. 14th, 1830.</i>
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Hugh</span>,</p>

<p>Thy very acceptable letter of the 21st ultimo, was duly
received, and read with interest, tending to excite renewed
sympathetic, and mutual fellow-feeling; and brought to my
remembrance the cheering salutation of the blessed Jesus, our
holy and perfect pattern and example, to his disciples, viz:
“Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.” By which he
assured his disciples that, by walking in the same pathway of
self-denial and the cross which he trod to blessedness, they
might also overcome the world; as nothing has ever enabled
any rational being, in any age of the world, to overcome the
spirit of the world, which lieth in wickedness, but the cross of
Christ.</p>

<p>Some may query, what is the cross of Christ? To these I
answer, it is the perfect law of God written on the tablet of the
heart, and in the heart of every rational creature, in such indelible
characters that all the power of mortals cannot erase nor
obliterate. Neither is there any power or means given or dispensed
to the children of men, but this inward law and light by
which the true and saving knowledge of God can be obtained.
And by this inward law and light, all will be either justified or
condemned, and all be made to know God for themselves, and
be left without excuse, agreeably to the prophecy of Jeremiah,
and the corroborating testimony of Jesus in his last counsel and
command to his disciples, not to depart from Jerusalem until they
should receive power from on high; assuring them that they
should receive power, when they had received the pouring forth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_440"></a>[Pg 440]</span>
of the spirit upon them, which would qualify them to bear witness
of him in Judea, Jerusalem, Samaria, and to the uttermost parts
of the earth; which was verified in a marvellous manner on the
day of Pentecost, when thousands were converted to the Christian
faith in one day. By which it is evident, that nothing but
this inward light and law, as it is heeded and obeyed, ever did,
or ever can make a true and real Christian and child of God.
And until the professors of Christianity agree to lay aside all
their non-essentials in religion, and rally to this unchangeable
foundation and standard of truth, wars and fightings, confusion
and error will prevail, and the angelic song cannot be heard in
our land, that of “glory to God in the highest, and on earth
peace and good will to men.” But when all nations are made
willing to make this inward law and light, the rule and standard
of all their faith and works, then we shall be brought to
know and believe alike, that there is but one Lord, one faith,
and but one baptism; one God and Father, that is above all,
through all, and in all; and then will all those glorious and
consoling prophecies, recorded in the scriptures of truth be fulfilled.
Isaiah ii. 4, “He,” the Lord, “shall judge among the
nations, and rebuke many people: and they shall beat their
swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks:
nation shall not lift up sword against nation; neither shall they
learn war any more.” Isaiah xi. “The wolf also shall dwell
with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid;
and the calf, and the young lion, and the fatling together; and
a little child shall lead them. And the cow and the bear shall
feed; their young ones shall lie down together; and the lion
shall eat straw like the ox. And the sucking child shall play
on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child put his hand on
the cockatrice’s den. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all
my holy mountain: for the earth,” that is our earthly tabernacles,
“shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters
cover the sea.”</p>

<p>These scripture testimonies give a true and correct description
of the gospel state, and no rational being can be a real Christian
and true disciple of Christ, until he comes to know all these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_441"></a>[Pg 441]</span>
things verified in his own experience, as every man and woman has
more or less of all those different animal propensities and passions
in their nature; and they predominate and bear rule, and are
the source and fountain from whence all wars, and every evil
work proceed, and will continue as long as man remains in his
first nature, and is governed by his animal spirit and propensities,
which constitute the natural man, which Paul tells us “receiveth
not the things of the spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto
him, neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.”
This corroborates the declaration of Jesus to Nicodemus,
“that, except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom
of God;” for “that which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that
which is born of the spirit is spirit.” Here Jesus assures us,
beyond all doubt, that nothing but spirit can either see or enter
into the kingdom of God; and this confirms Paul’s doctrine, that
“as many as are led by the spirit of God are the sons of God,”
and “joint heirs with Christ.” And Jesus assures us, by his
declaration to his disciples, John xiv. 16, 17, “If ye love me, keep
my commandments; and I will pray the Father, and he shall
give you another comforter, that he may abide with you for ever,
even the spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive;” that is,
men and women in their natural state, who have not given up
to be led by this spirit of truth, that leads and guides into all
truth; “because they see him not, neither do they know him,
but ye know him, for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in
you.” And as these give up to be wholly led and guided by him,
the new birth is brought forth in them, and they witness the
truth of another testimony of Paul’s, even that of being created
anew in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God had foreordained
that all his new-born children should walk in them,
and thereby show forth by their fruits and good works, that they
were truly the children of God, born of his spirit, and taught of
him; agreeably to the testimony of the prophet, that “the children
of the Lord are all taught of the Lord, and in righteousness they
are established, and great is the peace of his children.” And
nothing can make them afraid that man can do unto them; as
saith the prophet in his appeal to Jehovah, “Thou wilt keep him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_442"></a>[Pg 442]</span>
in perfect peace, whose mind is staid on thee, because he trusteth
in thee.” Therefore, let every one that loves the truth, for God
is truth, “trust in the Lord for ever, for in the Lord Jehovah there
is everlasting strength.”</p>

<p>I write these things to thee, not as though thou didst not know
them, but as a witness to thy experience, as “two are better than
one, and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.”</p>

<p>I will now draw to a close, with just adding, for thy encouragement,
be of good cheer, for no new thing has happened to
us; for it has ever been the lot of the righteous to pass through
many trials and tribulations, in their passage to that glorious,
everlasting, peaceful, and happy abode, where all sorrow and
sighing come to an end&mdash;the value of which is above all price;
for when we have given all that we have and can give, and
suffered all that we can suffer, it is still infinitely below its real
value. And if we are favoured to gain an inheritance in that
blissful and peaceful abode, “where the wicked cease from troubling,
and the weary are at rest,” we must ascribe it all to the
unmerited mercy and loving-kindness of our heavenly Father,
who remains to be God over all, blessed for ever.</p>

<p>I will now conclude; and in the fulness of brotherly love to
thee and thine, in which my family unite, subscribe thy affectionate
friend,</p>

<p class="right">
ELIAS HICKS.
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To Hugh Judge.</span></p>

<p>Please present my love to all my friends, as way opens.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The writing of the preceding letter was the last act in the life
of this eminent individual, and the attentive reader will not fail
to regard it as an act of peculiar interest. It was as a seal to
the labours of a long life, and evinced the abiding and lively
efficacy of that internal principle which he had uniformly sought
as his director and preserver. But the work of this faithful servant
was now accomplished; “the silver cord was loosed,” and
that spirit which had been so diligently active in the service of
its Divine Master, was now to rest from its labours, and to reap<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_443"></a>[Pg 443]</span>
its reward. Just when he had finished the letter alluded to, he
was attacked with a paralytic affection, under the effects of which
he became gradually weaker; but his mind remained established
in great peace and serenity, and on the 27th of 2d month, 1830,
he calmly expired, aged nearly eighty-two years.</p>

<p>Of the character of this extraordinary man, it is not necessary
now to speak. The preceding pages describe the nature of his
engagements; and an estimate may thence be formed, of the
fervency of his spirit, and the brightness of his example. In
his general deportment, and in the expression of his countenance,
there was a remarkable union of gentleness and dignity, indicating
the habitual benevolence and solemnity of his feelings;
and his public communications were accompanied with a power
and an authority which demonstrated the purity of the source
from whence they were derived. The promotion of spiritual
holiness and practical righteousness in the earth, were the objects
of his constant solicitude; and he endeavoured, through divine
assistance, to exemplify in his own daily experience, the comprehensive
command of the prophet, “To do justly, to love
mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.”</p>

<p class="chap-head p2">THE MEMORIAL OF JERICHO MONTHLY MEETING OF
FRIENDS CONCERNING OUR ANCIENT FRIEND ELIAS
HICKS.</p>

<p>We believe the example exhibited in the life and religious
exercise of this our beloved Friend, is eminently calculated to
set forth the efficacy and sufficiency of that divine grace, which,
when believed in and obeyed, bringeth salvation.</p>

<p>He was born in the town of Hempstead, Queens county,
Long Island, state of New-York, the 19th day of the 3d month,
1748. His parents’ names were John and Martha Hicks. At
the age of seventeen he was placed as an apprentice to learn the
trade of a carpenter; on the expiration of his term, he returned
to his father, with whom he lived until the time of his marriage,
which took place about the twenty-third year of his age, to Jemima,
daughter of Jonathan and Elizabeth Seaman, of Jericho, in
said county, where he resided the remainder of his life.</p>

<p>From his own account we learn, that when very young, he
was favoured with clear and powerful impressions of divine
grace operating on his mind as a reprover for evil, which not
duly regarding, and being naturally of a lively and active disposition,
he associated with those who indulged in the vanities
and amusements too common in the world, though mostly in
things deemed innocent by the generality of mankind. But the
gift of divine grace, which was so early manifested, did not forsake
him, though he often strove to stifle its convictions, but
followed him in judgment and in mercy, until a willingness
was wrought in him to give up all to follow Christ, in the
regeneration. On one occasion, when preparing to join in the
dance, and surrounded by his jovial companions, the pure witness
rose so powerfully in his mind, and so clearly set before him the
evil tendency of the course he was pursuing, that he reasoned
not with flesh and blood, but gave up to the heavenly vision,
and in deep contrition and prostration of soul, entered into cove<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_445"></a>[Pg 445]</span>nant
with the God of his life, that if he would be pleased to
furnish him with strength, he would endeavour not to be again
found in the like disobedience; which covenant, through mercy,
he was favoured to keep inviolate. Thus, submitting to the purifying
operation of the Holy Ghost and fire, he was, in due time,
qualified and called to declare to others what God had done for
his soul; under the divine anointing, he was enabled to unfold
the truths of the gospel, in the demonstration of the spirit and
with power. And, through a faithful obedience to that which
had begun the good work in him, he became an eminent instrument
in the Lord’s hand, for the promotion of truth and
righteousness in the earth.</p>

<p>He first appeared in the ministry, about the twenty-seventh
year of his age, and from this period, his time and talents were
devoted to the cause of his Divine Master, labouring diligently
for its advancement, not only at home, and in his own neighbourhood,
but in most parts of this continent where there are
settlements of Friends, and also, in many places amongst those
not of our society. In declaring what he believed to be the
counsel of God, he was bold and fearless, and his ministry,
though unadorned with the embellishments of human learning,
was clear and powerful. In argument he was strong and convincing,
and his appeals to the experience and convictions of
his hearers, were striking and appropriate. He saw, and deeply
lamented the great departure of many in the society of Friends,
from that plainness and simplicity, and that godly sincerity,
which characterized it in the beginning. Hence he felt himself
called upon, under the influence of the love of the gospel, to
admonish his brethren in religious profession, to rally to the
ancient standard, the light of truth manifested in the heart, and
to follow no man any further, than he should be found a follower
of Christ. He assailed the strong holds of superstition and
bigotry with great boldness, which sometimes alarmed the timid,
and roused the prejudices of others. Yet to the candid inquirer
and sincere seeker after truth, he breathed the language of
encouragement, of consolation and of comfort. His great and
primary concern was to draw the minds of the people to prac<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_446"></a>[Pg 446]</span>tical
righteousness&mdash;from all outward dependance to the sure
foundation, the rock of ages, the spirit of truth, the comforter,
“Christ within, the hope of glory.” He generally corroborated
the doctrines which he preached, by appropriate references to the
testimonies and experience of those who have gone before us,
as recorded in the scriptures of truth. Through the efficacy of
that power which enabled him to say, “By the grace of God, I
am what I am,” many were convinced of the truth, through his
ministry.</p>

<p>So full and pointed was his testimony against a hireling
ministry, which he held to be, not only in direct violation of the
great gospel precept “Freely ye have received, freely give,” but
fraught with incalculable injury to the best interests of mankind,
that he sometimes gave offence to those, whose minds were
strongly biased in its favour. Yet such was the general kindness
and benevolence of his character, that he did not willingly
give offence to any. While he condemned the practice, he was
kind and charitable to those, who, through the influence of
education and early prejudice, differed from him on this subject.
Such was his concern that his examples should comport with
his testimony, that he was scrupulously careful to defray his
own expenses when travelling as a minister.</p>

<p>When his meetings were attended by a large concourse of
persons of various denominations, the solemnity and stillness that
prevailed, were often very remarkable, reminding us of the testimony
of primitive Friends, that the power accompanying their
gospel labours so overshadowed the assemblies, that truth reigned
over all. Being deeply sensible of his own inability to promote
the cause of truth and righteousness, without divine aid, he
was engaged to dwell near the fountain of light and life, and
to minister as this opened and gave ability. He was indeed
an example of Christian humility, and eminently preserved from
being elated by the applause of men, or depressed by their censure.
Many were the exercises which he felt on account of the
evils which abound in the world, and the oppressed condition of
the African race excited his tenderest sympathy. Their cause
engaged his earnest solicitude for the greater part of his life, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_447"></a>[Pg 447]</span>
he was often led feelingly and powerfully to advocate it. We
believe that many were convinced, through his labours, of the
cruelty and injustice of holding them in bondage. He bore for
many years a faithful testimony against slavery, by carefully
abstaining from the use of articles which he believed to be produced
by the labour of slaves. When at home, and not engaged
in services more strictly of a religious character, he laboured diligently
with his own hands, believing it the duty of all to
be usefully employed in obtaining the necessaries of life; and
when acquired, he acted as a steward under the direction of the
bountiful Giver, being restrained from using them for selfish gratification.
In the various relations of life he was a bright example,
worthy of imitation: he was an affectionate husband; and as a
father and guardian, his concern for the religious and moral
education of his children, and those placed under his care, was
very great, that they might be brought up in the fear and admonition
of the Lord. For these ends he exercised the authority
of a parent with firmness, but in much tenderness and love. His
tender sympathy was excited for the poor, to whom he was a
kind and liberal friend, often supplying their necessities. It may
be truly said of him, that he was a man fearing God and hating
covetousness. He was a peace-maker, endeavouring, both by
precept and example, to promote harmony in his neighbourhood;
and in this respect he was very useful, his Christian deportment
having gained the confidence and affection of his neighbours.
He was very diligent in the attendance of religious meetings,
and often led to encourage others, assuring them, from his own
experience, that none could expect to increase in the divine life,
until they considered that important duty paramount to temporal
concerns: he was also conspicuously useful in supporting the
discipline of the society.</p>

<p>At a very advanced age he continued to labour in the Lord’s
vineyard, with the same fervent zeal, the same dedication of
heart, for which he had been so eminently distinguished in the
earlier stages of his life; and in the exercise of his gift in the
ministry, he was as lively, clear, and cogent, as at any former
period. Having been long taught in the school of Christ, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_448"></a>[Pg 448]</span>
being deeply experienced in the things which concern our eternal
well-being, he was well qualified to administer counsel and
encouragement to others; and was frequently led, feelingly and
forcibly, to impress upon the minds of the rising generation, the
importance and necessity of early attention to the inward discoveries
of divine light; cautioning them not to rest in the tradition
of their fathers, but to walk by the same rule, and to mind
the same thing, which has led the righteous in all ages safely
through time; nor to depend upon the teachings of men, for that
knowledge which brings life and immortality to light in the soul;
declaring that faithfulness and obedience to the influence of
divine grace in their own hearts, could only qualify them to
advance the standard of truth and righteousness in the earth.
His dedication to the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus, his
firmness in the support of those testimonies which he felt himself
called upon to maintain, and his plainness in reproving unfaithfulness
in others, and bearing testimony against every appearance
of evil, gave offence to some; yet none of these things moved
him, neither counted he his life dear to himself, so that he might
finish his course with joy, and the ministry he had received, to
testify the gospel of the grace of God; and we are persuaded
that his feet were established upon that rock, against which the
powers of darkness shall never be able to prevail. He was
favoured, in times of the greatest trial, to experience the truth of
the prophetic declaration, “Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace,
whose mind is stayed on thee, because he trusteth in thee.”</p>

<p>He was favoured with a good constitution, and in the decline
of life, was still actively engaged in the concerns of society, and
industriously employed in his temporal avocations.</p>

<p>His mental powers continued strong and vigorous to the end
of his labours. His comprehensive and energetic mind was
apparently but very little impaired by the revolution of more
than fourscore years. Within the last two years of his life, he
travelled extensively in the work of the ministry.</p>

<p>When he was eighty years of age, he opened in this monthly
meeting a concern to pay a religious visit to Friends and others
in some parts of the yearly meetings of New-York, Philadelphia,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_449"></a>[Pg 449]</span>
Baltimore, Virginia, Ohio, and Indiana. He obtained a certificate
of unity and concurrence from this monthly meeting, endorsed
by Westbury quarterly meeting. In this visit he experienced
many deep probations on account of the unsettled state of society.
“For the divisions of Reuben, there were great searchings of
heart.” Yet he was enabled to accomplish his visit to the
southern and western yearly meetings, agreeably to his prospect.
Shortly after his return from this journey, he met with a severe
affliction in the loss of his beloved companion, with whom he
had lived in near union and affection for fifty-eight years.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1829, in pursuance of his prospect as before
mentioned, he visited most of the meetings of Friends in the
northern and western parts of our yearly meeting. His gospel
labours, during these arduous and extensive visits, were productive
of satisfaction and peace to his own mind, and were peculiarly
seasonable and acceptable to his friends, as appears by numerous
certificates of near unity, which he produced to this meeting on
his return home; after which, he attended all the meetings of
Friends in the city of New-York, and on this island, very much
to their satisfaction. In these last visits, as heretofore, his gospel
labours were remarkably clear and powerful, and we trust
are profitably remembered by many. He seemed renewedly
concerned on account of the deviations from that plainness and
simplicity into which the truth would lead; and expressed the
comfort it would be to him to see a reformation in these respects.</p>

<p>On first day morning, the 14th of 2d month last, he was
engaged in his room, writing to a friend, until a little after ten
o’clock, when he returned to that occupied by the family, apparently
just attacked by a paralytic affection, which nearly deprived
him of the use of his right side, and of the power of speech. Being
assisted to a chair near the fire, he manifested by signs, that the
letter which he had just finished, and which had been dropped
by the way, should be taken care of; and on its being brought
to him, appeared satisfied, and manifested a desire that all should
sit down and be still, seemingly sensible that his labours were
brought to a close, and only desirous of quietly waiting the final
change. The solemn composure at this time manifest in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_450"></a>[Pg 450]</span>
countenance, was very impressive, indicating that he was sensible
the time of his departure was at hand, and that the prospect
of death brought no terrors with it. During his last illness, his
mental faculties were occasionally obscured, yet he was at times
enabled to give satisfactory evidence to those around him, that
all was well, and that he felt nothing in his way.</p>

<p>His dependance had long been upon that arm of power alone,
which supported him under every probation, and near the conclusion
of the letter above alluded to, he thus expressed himself:
“And if we are favoured to gain an inheritance in that blissful
and peaceful abode, where the wicked cease from troubling, and
the weary are at rest, we must ascribe it all to the unmerited
mercy and loving kindness of our heavenly Father, who remains
to be God over all, blessed for ever.” He continued gradually to
decline until the evening of the 27th, when he quietly passed
from the trials of time, we doubt not, to receive the reward of
the righteous.</p>

<p>His funeral took place on fourth day, the 3d of 3d month. It
was attended by a large concourse of Friends and others, and a
solid meeting was held on the occasion; after which, his remains
were interred in Friends’ burial ground at this place.</p>
